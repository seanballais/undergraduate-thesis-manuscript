\chapter{Objectives}
This study primarily aims to develop an approach that integrates a relatively new metaheuristic, Grey Wolf Optimization, to solve the unequal area static facility layout problem. Other objectives of this study are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in generating solutions to the unequal area static facility layout problem.
	
	\item To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach with varying parameters for various aspects of the approach.
	
	\item To compare the performance of the proposed approach to the performance of a genetic algorithm-based approach.
\end{enumerate}
