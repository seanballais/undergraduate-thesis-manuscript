\chapter{Objectives}

This study is primarily aims to apply deep learning via artificial neural networks to the problem of vectorizing semi-structured imagery. However, there are still some key objectives that this study seeks to accomplish:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To develop an approach that considers Gestalt psychology.
	
	\item To evaluate the effectiveness of using deep learning for image vectorization.
	
	\item To evaluate the accuracy of results obtained from the proposed approach to the target raster inputs.
	
	\item To evaluate and compare the results of the proposed approach to that of previous semi-structured image vectorization methods.
	
	\item To evaluate and compare the speed of the proposed approach compared to previous semi-structured image vectorization methods.
\end{enumerate}
