\chapter{Describing How You Solved the Problem or Answered the Question}

This part of the thesis is much more free-form. It may have one or several
sections and subsections. But it all has only one purpose: to convince the
examiners that you answered the question or solved the problem that you
set for yourself in Chapter~\ref{sec:ResearchQ}. So show what you did that is relevant to answering the question or solving the problem: if there were blind alleys and dead ends, do not include these, unless specifically relevant to the
demonstration that you answered the thesis question.
