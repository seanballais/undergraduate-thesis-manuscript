                           Why use Latex ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * most other wordprocessors are pretty lousy at printing formulas
 * most of the available technical articles are written using Latex
 * many books are written in Latex
 * Latex allows you to print typeset-quality material
 * using Latex is part of your training as researchers
 * it will take a long time before Latex becomes obsolete
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know nothing about Latex and I have to prepare my final report/thesis today. Help !
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't despair.  Here's how to write that report/thesis.

Read the following instructions carefully:

1. Download updcsthesis.tgz to a UNIX/Linux machine.

2. Unzip and untar the example file using the command

	gunzip -c updcsthesis.tgz | tar xvf -

   A directory named updcsthesis will be created containing
   the source files

3. Change the directory name to your group's login name.  For example, if
   your login name is "juan", change the directory name using the command

	mv updcsthesis juan

4. Hop into the directory.  It contains two subdirectories named figure
   and source.  All your figures should be saved in the figures subdirectory.
   Figures should be in postscript format for Latex to process them without 
   problems.

   Many softwares such as Matlab are capable of saving figures, graphs,
   diagrams, etc. in Postscript format.  The Unix tool xfig is a popular
   tool for drawing diagrams.   

5. Hop into the source subdirectory. You should see several template files
   there.  The files you should be editing are

	thesis.tex
	abstract.tex
	acknowl.tex
	biblio.tex
	chapter1.tex
	chapter2.tex
	chapter3.tex
             ...
	chaptern.tex
        appendix.tex

6. As they are, these files contain some sample text and figure formatting
   instructions.  Try them out by typing

	make biblio

7. To view your document just type the following

	xdvi thesis.dvi &

8. Change the contents of the files with your own text.  Don't forget to
   edit the biblio.bib.  Type

	make biblio
	make thesis

   Once you are done with everything, type

	make postscript
	make pdf

   A file called thesis.ps aand thesis.pdf will be created.  View these files 
   with your favorite postscipt and pdf viewers.

9. Rename thesis.ps and thesis.pdf to <login-name>.ps and <login-name>.pdf.
   Print your thesis using ghostview.

   Type 

	make clean

  to clean up your directory.  Type the following afterwards

        cd ..
	tar cvf <login-name>.tar <login-name>
	gzip <login-name>.tar
	mv <login-name>.tar.gz <login-name>.tgz

10. Submit to your adviser the file <login-name>.tgz.
    Include the file <login-name>.tgz in the recordable CD that you
    should submit with your soft copies.
