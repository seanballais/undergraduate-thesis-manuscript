In 1623, an English poet by the name of John Donne has written an essay containing the widely quoted excerpt, "No man is an island.". These words have proven to be true throughout history and manifests itself in the human experience in general. This work of ours is obviously not an exception to this, and has benefited from the wisdom and inputs of different people from different walks of life.
