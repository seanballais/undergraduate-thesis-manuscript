abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

ANN for predicting properties of welded plates by FSW is explained and pervious works in this field are reviewed. Furthermore, some examples about appliccations of ANN in FSW are presented. The development of sound joints between materials is of great importance in FSW. One of the most challengin problems in choosing appropriate welding parameters in order to produce sound joint. Traditionally, a time-consuming trial and error development was carried out to dewtermine welding parameters. Additionally, an optimized welding parameters combinataion was not achieved, because welds can be fabricated with very different ideal welding parameters. Different optimization techniques can be employed to determinethe optimized output parameters by specifying the relation between the input and output variables. Applications of optimization methods in FSW are explained, and basic principles of these methods, such as Taguchi, genetic optimization, and multi-objective optimzation methods, are described.},

As there are conflicting criteria's according to LEED and BREAM sustainable site parameters, local regulations and local climate conditions, an efficient decision support system can be developed by the help of Pareto based non-dominated genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) which is used for several possibly conflicting objectives that need to be considered together.

In this paper, an intelligent based algorithm for optimal BTS site placement has been proposed. The proposed technique takes into consideration neighbour and regulation considerations objectively while determining cell site. The application will lead to a quantitatively unbiased evaluated decision making process in BTS placement. An experimental data of a 2km by 3km territory was simulated for testing the new algorithm, results obtained show a 100{\%} performance of the neighbour constrained algorithm in BTS placement optimization.

However, the analysis of why and how risks should be taken into account does not seem to be considered as a global question by researchers, who have mostly focused on specific problems, such as stochasticity or uncertainty. The aim of this article is to point out the importance of risk management and control at a more global level during the design of production systems. More particularly, we discuss opportunities to design facility layout solutions that contribute to avoid, prevent, or reduce certain types of industrial risks taken in the broad sense (flow risks, reliability risks, quality risks, safety risks, environment risks, etc.). We discuss the kinds of risks that such facility layout solutions would allow considering. We address the issue of how to represent risks so that they could be taken into account, and we review existing academic and industrial approaches that are close to this topic. We show that approaching risks with facility layout solutions is a promising research direction that is worth more investigation. {\textcopyright} IEOM Society International.},

abstract = {This work proposes a new methodology and mathematical formulation to address the facility layout problem.The goal is to minimise the total material handling cost subjected to production-derived constraints. This cost is a function of the distance that the products should cover within the facility. The first idea is to use the A ∗ algorithm to identify the distances between workstations in a more realistic way. A ∗ determines the shortest path within the facility that contains obstacles and transportation routes. The second idea is to combine a genetic algorithm and the A ∗ algorithm with a homogenous methodology to improve the quality of the facility layouts. In an iterative way, the layout solution space is explored using the genetic algorithm. We study the impacts of the appropriate crossover and mutation operators and the values of the parameters used in this algorithm on the cost of the proposed arrangements. These operators and parameter values are fine-tuned using Monte Carlo simulations. The facility arrangements are all compared and discussed based on their material handling cost associated with the Euclidean distance, rectilinear distance, and A ∗ algorithm. Finally, we present a set of conclusions regarding the suggested methodology and discuss our future research goals.},

abstract = {Today, the concept of open plan is more and more widely accepted that many companies have switched to open-plan offices. Their design is an issue in the scope of space layout planning. Although there are many professional architectural layout design software in the market, in the real life, office designers seldom use these tools because their license fees are usually expensive and using them to solve an open-plan office design is like using an overly powerful and expensive tool to fix a minor problem. Therefore, manual drafting through a trial and error process is most often used. This article attempts to propose a lightweight tool to automate open-plan office layout generation using a nested genetic algorithm optimization with two layers, where the inner layer algorithm is embedded in the outer one. The result is enhanced by a local search. The main objective is to maximize space utilization by maximizing the size of the open workspace. This approach is different from its precedents, in that the location search is conducted on a grid map rather than several pre-selected candidate locations. Consequently, the generated layout design presents a less rigid workstation arrangement, inviting a casual and unrestrictive work environment. The real potential of the approach is reflected in the productivity of test fits. Automating and simplifying the generation of layouts for test fits can tremendously decrease the amount of time and resources required to generate them. The experimental case study shows that the developed approach is powerful and effective, making it a totally automated process.},

EASE comprises a novel sub-heuristic that constructs valid spatial layouts, a mathematical framework to quantify the satisfaction of constraints, and evolutionary operators to improve alternative layouts' fitness. We test EASE on the design of a library building. We evaluate EASE's performance for different building forms and different evolutionary algorithm parameters. The results suggest that EASE can generate valid layouts, quantify the constraints' degree of satisfaction and find a number of optimal layout solutions. The layouts that EASE generates are intended not as end results but design artifacts that provide insight into the solution space for further exploration.},

abstract = {The dynamic construction site layout planning (DCSLP) problem refers to the efficient placement and relocation of temporary construction facilities within a dynamically changing construction site environment considering the characteristics of facilities and work interrelationships, the shape and topography of the construction site, and the time-varying project needs. A multi-objective dynamic optimization model is developed for this problem that considers construction and relocation costs of facilities, transportation costs of resources moving from one facility to another or to workplaces, as well as safety and environmental considerations resulting from facilities' operations and interconnections. The latter considerations are taken into account in the form of preferences or constraints regarding the proximity or remoteness of particular facilities to other facilities or work areas. The analysis of multiple project phases and the dynamic facility relocation from phase to phase highly increases the problem size, which, even in its static form, falls within the NP (for Nondeterministic Polynomial time)-hard class of combinatorial optimization problems. For this reason, a genetic algorithm has been implemented for the solution due to its capability to robustly search within a large solution space. Several case studies and operational scenarios have been implemented through the Palisade's Evolver software for model testing and evaluation. The results indicate satisfactory model response to time-varying input data in terms of solution quality and computation time. The model can provide decision support to site managers, allowing them to examine alternative scenarios and fine-tune optimal solutions according to their experience by introducing desirable preferences or constraints in the decision process.},

abstract = {The unequal area facility layout problem (UA-FLP) has been addressed by many methods. Most of them only take aspects that can be quantified into account. This contribution presents a novel approach, which considers both quantitative aspects and subjective features. To this end, a multi-objective interactive genetic algorithm is proposed with the aim of allowing interaction between the algorithm and the human expert designer, normally called the decision maker (DM) in the field of UA-FLP. The contribution of the DM's knowledge into the approach guides the complex search process, adjusting it to the DM's preferences. The entire population associated to facility layout designs is evaluated by quantitative criteria in combination with an assessment prepared by the DM, who gives a subjective evaluation for a set of representative individuals of the population in each iteration. In order to choose these individuals, a soft computing clustering method is used. Two interesting real-world data sets are analysed to empirically probe the robustness of these models. The first UA-FLP case study describes an ovine slaughterhouse plant and the second, a design for recycling carton plant. Relevant results are obtained, and interesting conclusions are drawn from the application of this novel intelligent framework.},

The proposed clonal selection algorithm (CSA) has a new encoding and a novel procedure to cope with dummy departments that are introduced to fill the empty space in the facility area. The algorithm showed consistent performance for the 25 test problem cases studied. The problems with 100 and 125 were studied with FBS first time in the literature. CSA provided four new best FBS solutions and reached to sixteen best-so-far FBS solutions. Further, the two very large size test problems were solved first time using FBS representation, and results significantly improved the previous best known solutions. The overall results state that CSA with FBS representation was successful in 95.65{\%} of the test problems when compared with the best-so-far FBS results and 90.90{\%} compared with the best known solutions that have not used FBS representation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Genetic algorithm (GA) is an artificial intelligence search method that uses the process of evolution and natural selection theory and is under the umbrella of evolutionary computing algorithm. It is an efficient tool for solving optimization problems. Integration among (GA) parameters is vital for successful (GA) search. Such parameters include mutation and crossover rates in addition to population that are important issues in (GA). However, each operator of GA has a special and different influence. The impact of these factors is influenced by their probabilities; it is difficult to predefine specific ratios for each parameter, particularly, mutation and crossover operators. This paper reviews various methods for choosing mutation and crossover ratios in GAs. Next, we define new deterministic control approaches for crossover and mutation rates, namely Dynamic Decreasing of high mutation ratio/dynamic increasing of low crossover ratio (DHM/ILC), and Dynamic Increasing of Low Mutation/Dynamic Decreasing of High Crossover (ILM/DHC). The dynamic nature of the proposed methods allows the ratios of both crossover and mutation operators to be changed linearly during the search progress, where (DHM/ILC) starts with 100{\%} ratio for mutations, and 0{\%} for crossovers. Both mutation and crossover ratios start to decrease and increase, respectively. By the end of the search process, the ratios will be 0{\%} for mutations and 100{\%} for crossovers. (ILM/DHC) worked the same but the other way around. The proposed approach was compared with two parameters tuning methods (predefined), namely fifty-fifty crossover/mutation ratios, and the most common approach that uses static ratios such as (0.03) mutation rates and (0.9) crossover rates. The experiments were conducted on ten Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP). The experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed (DHM/ILC) when dealing with small population size, while the proposed (ILM/DHC) was found to be more effective when using large population size. In fact, both proposed dynamic methods outperformed the predefined methods compared in most cases tested.},

It has been over six decades since Koopmans and Beckmann published their seminal paper on modeling the FLP. Since then, there have been improvements to these researchers' original quadratic assignment problem. However, research on many aspects of the FLP is still in its initial stage; hence, the issue is an interesting field to work on. Here, a review of literature is made by referring to numerous papers about FLPs. The study is mainly motivated by the current and prospective trends of research on such points as layout evolution, workshop characteristics, problem formulation, and solution methodologies. It points to gaps in the literature and suggests promising directions for future research on FLP.},

Safe site selection (SSS) largely depends upon compiling, analyzing, and refining the information of an area where a building is likely to be located. The locational and topographical aspects of an area located in hilly regions play a major role in SSS, but are generally neglected in traditional and CAD-based systems used for site selection. Architects and engineers select a site based on their judgment, knowledge, and experience, but issues related to site safety are generally ignored. This study reviewed the existing literature on site selection techniques, building codes, and approaches of existing standards to identify various aspects crucial for SSS in hilly regions. A questionnaire survey was conducted to identify various aspects that construction professionals consider critical for SSS. This study explored the application of geographic information systems (GIS) in modeling the locational and topographical aspects to identify areas of suitability.

With the growth of population in Hong Kong, there is a need to develop some new residential areas continuously and to decentralize population in the outlying areas such as the satellite towns and/or new towns. The land use planning consists of identifying and selecting potential development areas to meet the expected land requirements. The optimal land use development problem relates to the allocation of population with optimal objective function value. In this case the land production cost includes formation of new areas, construction of public works infrastructure, and provision of other utility services. The optimal land use development plan is chosen from a large number of potential development areas and potential population allocation. This problem can be formulated as a 0-1 programming problem mathematically. In this paper, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the 0-1 programming problem in which some new land use plans are identified in Hong Kong so as to minimise the total development and transportation cost. It is the first work to apply genetic algorithm for land use problem in practice. The developed model will advance this subject and help the authorities decide which new residential areas should be considered for detailed investigation.

Urban layout is very important for the development of urban transportation and building system. Once the layout of the city is finalized, it will be difficult to start again. Therefore, the urban architectural layout planning and design have a very important impact. This paper uses the urban architecture layout big data for building layout optimization using advanced computation techniques. Firstly, a big data collection and storage system based on the Hadoop platform is established. Then, the evaluation model of urban building planning based on improved logit and PSO algorithm is established. The PSO algorithm is used to find the suitable area for this kind of building layout, and then through five impact indicators: land prices, rail transit, historical protection, road traffic capacity, and commercial potential have been established by using the following logit linear regression model. Then, the bridge between logit and PSO algorithm is established by the fitness value of particle. The particle in the particle swarm is assigned to the index parameter of logit model, and then the logit model in the evaluation system is run. The performance index corresponding to the set of parameters is obtained. The performance index is passed to the PSO as the fitness value of the particle to search for the best adaptive position. The reasonable degree of regional architectural planning is obtained, and the rationality of urban architectural planning layout is determined.},

abstract = {The facility layout problem (FLP) is the problem of placing facilities in a certain shop floor so that facilities do not overlap each other and are satisfied with some given objectives. Considering practical situations, this study focuses on the multi-objective unequal-area facility layout problem (UA-FLP), where the facilities have unequal-areas and fixed shapes and are placed orthogonally in the continuous shop floor. The objectives of the problem aim to optimize the material handling cost, the total adjacency value and the utilization ratio of the shop floor. The chief difficulties of this version of the FLP lie in the satisfaction of non-overlapping constraint between any two different facilities and the optimization of multiple objectives in the huge solution space. In this paper, we put forward a heuristic configuration mutation operation and subsequent local search based on the gradient method to satisfy the non-overlapping constraint, and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, which has recently proven its high effectiveness and robustness in solving multi-objective problems, to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions of the problem. The novelty of the paper lies in the use of an objective space division method in the MOPSO which governs the neighborhood topology and the local best swarm used to assess the global fitness of a solution and choose the global leader particle. The proposed algorithm is tested on three sets of different UA-FLPs from the literature with the size of the problem up to 62 facilities. The numerical results show that the proposed method is effective in solving the multi-objective UA-FLP.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an application of simulated annealing to facility layout problems with single and multiple floors. The facility layout problem is highly combinatorial in nature and generally exhibits many local minima. These properties make it a suitable candidate for simulated annealing. Using a new candidate layout generation routine and spacefilling curves, we develop an improvement-type layout algorithm based on simulated annealing that considers an expanded set of department exchanges. The resulting algorithm achieves low-cost solutions that are much less dependent on the initial layout than other approaches. We compare the performance of the simulated-annealing based algorithm with both steepest-descent and randomized approaches from the literature. Unlike other simulated annealing papers which typically present a statistical experiment to evaluate the effect of numerous control settings, all the experiments presented in this paper were conducted with control settings that are constant or easily specified. This approach facilitates the application of the proposed algorithm to real-life facility layout problems in both single and multiple floor facilities. Although the algorithm presented here can be applied to many types of facilities, our primary focus is on production facilities. {\textcopyright} 1996 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {It has been shown that pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) choice can affect simple genetic algorithm (GA) performance. However, these performance impacts are non-intuitive; PRNGs of poor quality can drive GAs to superior performance, for certain problems. The same PRNGs cause worse performance for other problems. In this paper, we present a plausible explanation for this phenomenon: PRNGs of poor quality cause higher Vose discrepancy values than do higer quality PRNGs. Higher Vose discrepancy values could then be manifest as GA performance differences, as GA populations move toward fixed points of the Vose heuristic far away from the expectation.},

abstract = {Facility layout problem is one of the most important problems in a huge range of industries and services organizations. Simultaneous study of some qualitative and quantitative parameters like closeness relationship between facilities, physical constraints such as input/output points and how to arrange facilities can play a key role to determine the facility layout. Considering these parameters can lead to reduce production costs, increase production capacity, and remove additional displacements. A two-stage approach is proposed to achieve these goals. In the first stage, a goal programming model is proposed to determine weights of the attributes based on the experts' opinions with different preference representation structures. Afterwards, the closeness ratings of the facilities are calculated using weights of attributes. In the second stage, an efficient layout is designed by determining facilities placement sequence, location of the next facility adjacent to the previous one, location of input/output points, and rectilinear feasible shortest path between facilities. Two meta-heuristic algorithms including particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm are designed due to computational complexity. The objective function is to minimize the sum of products distance between facilities and closeness rating and also to minimize the dead space. A case study of an Auto Body Parts company is demonstrated to verify the efficiency of the proposed two-stage approach. Furthermore, in order to assess the performance of the proposed approach, a comparison is drawn between the proposed approach and five existing approaches in the literature to solve different problems by using the two meta-heuristic algorithms.},

abstract = {Universities comprise buildings in which education, teaching, research and practice are undertaken as well as physical structures with social and cultural activity spaces. They've a constantly evolving and changing structure in parallel to an increase in the number of students and the educational structures. Increasing number of physical structures result in failure to meet students' requirements for open space. Nevertheless, university campuses should ensure that students who do not know each other get to know each other and get used to the environment to which they are strangers by providing students with common living spaces. For this reason, it was considered to re-design an outdoor area (festival area) in Karadeniz technical university campus, where students can perform their extracurricular activities and increase their social relations with one another. As a result of the literature review, it was seen that most of the studies are either carried out only to design successful outdoor spaces for the needs of the users or the spaces designed by other people are assessed after use. Consequently, it was determined that there are certain deficits in determining whether the spaces designed in line with the decisions made by the researcher fulfil user needs. For this reason, it was aimed in this study to make the post-use evaluation of the production process after the outdoor design process of a campus outdoor space is completed by the researcher. The present study was conducted in Kanuni Park (festival area) in main campus of Karadeniz Technical University, which is currently used as a parking lot only and sometimes used as a concert venue at certain times of the year. The objective of the study was to realize spatial organization of the said study area so that it meets the students' needs and requirements, serves as a space where various activities take place, and provides facilities for a variety of uses (affordance) on a continuous basis, rather than at certain times of the year. Therefore, programming/design/construction/occupancy/post occupancy evaluation processes which comprise spatial development process were performed within Kanuni Park and such processes were evaluated.},

abstract = {The optimal solution to any facility layout problem is an important aspect and a major concern as it involves significant material handling and transportation cost. The objective is to arrange the departments within the predefined facility boundaries in the way that the interaction between the functions is efficient and the overall movement cost is minimized. While facility layout problems have traditionally focused on manufacturing facilities, there has been little work on analyzing layouts for hospitals. The thesis focuses on hospital facility layout problems (HLP) to (i) minimize the movements of patients and (ii) minimize the movements of accompanying resources such as doctors, nurses, equipment and paramedical staff. The thesis consists of two sections. In the first section, a model for the multi-floor layout problem is presented based on the minimization of movement cost. The model has travel frequency or number of trips, trip diffculty rating, baseline travel cost and distance as parameters for determining the movement cost. In the second section, some additional parameters and constraints are imposed on the model and it is simulated using Microsoft Excel. Simulations are also run to study the effect of different proposed strategies on movement cost. These proposed strategies show a reduction in movement cost from the sample layout strategy in section one. A representative example is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed formulation.},

abstract = {We address the Unequal-Area Facility-Layout Problem (UA-FLP), which aims to dimension and locate rectangular facilities in an unlimited floor space, without overlap, while minimizing the sum of distances among facilities weighted by “material-handling” flows. We introduce two algorithmic approaches to address this problem: a basic Genetic Algorithm (GA), and a GA combined with a decomposition strategy via partial solution deconstructions and reconstructions. To efficiently decompose the problem, we impose a solution structure where no facility should cross the X or Y axis. Although this restriction can possibly deteriorate the value of the best achievable solution, it also greatly enhances the search capabilities of the method on medium and large problem instances. For most such instances, current exact methods are impracticable. As highlighted by our experiments, the resulting algorithm produces solutions of high quality for the two classic datasets of the literature, improving six out of the eight best known solutions from the first set, with up to 125 facilities, and all medium- and large-scale instances from the second set. For some of the largest instances of the second set, with 90 or 100 facilities, the average solution improvement goes as high as 6 percent or 7 percent when compared to previous algorithms, in less CPU time. We finally introduce additional instances with up to 150 facilities. On this benchmark, the decomposition method provides an average solution improvement with respect to the basic GA of about 9 percent and 1.3 percent on short and long runs, respectively.},

abstract = {Efficient layout planning of a construction site is fundamental for successful project undertaking as it enhances both productivity and safety in construction sites. This task usually consists of identifying the temporary facilities needed to support construction operations, determining their size and shape, and optimally positioning them in the unoccupied areas within the site boundaries. The site layout planning problem is a complex combinatorial optimization problem involving multiple objectives and it grows significantly in size as the number of facilities and constraints increases. The existing literature includes a variety of analytical, heuristic, and meta-heuristic techniques for solving the problem but existing studies usually examine a small number of facilities and focus on travel distance minimization, ignoring generally cost related or other decision parameters. The objective of this study is to develop feasible and efficient site layout solutions in a realistic representation scheme taking into consideration not only the total distance traveled but also cost and safety parameters as well. A multi-objective optimization model is developed aiming at minimizing a generalized cost function which results from the construction cost of a facility placed at alternative locations, the transportation cost among locations, and any safety concern in the form of preferred proximity or remoteness of particular facilities to other facilities or work areas. The development integrates the required robust search objective with the optimization capabilities of the genetic algorithms (GAs). The model has been tested on several test cases and the results of a comparative study with existing methods from the literature are presented. The evaluation indicates that the proposed model provides effective and rational solutions, in response to decision parameters and problem constraints, and that it results in more robust layout planning than previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

For more than one decade, many researchers have proposed different algorithms for this problem. After reviewing the shortcomings of these algorithms, we realize that the performance can be further improved by a more intelligent search. This paper develops an effective novel hybrid multi-population genetic algorithm. Using a proposed heuristic procedure, we separate solution space into different parts and each subpopulation represents a separate part. This assures the diversity of the algorithm. Moreover, to intensify the search more and more, a powerful local search mechanism based on simulated annealing is developed. Unlike the available genetic operators previously proposed for this problem, we design the operators so as to search only the feasible space; thus, we save computational time by avoiding infeasible space. To evaluate the algorithm, we comprehensively discuss the parameter tuning of the algorithms by Taguchi method. The perfectly tuned algorithm is then compared with 11 available algorithms in the literature using well-known set of benchmark instances. Different analyses conducted on the results, show that the proposed algorithm enjoys the superiority and outperformance over the other algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia.

abstract = {Facilities layout problem is one of the important issues affecting the productivity of manufacturing systems. This problem deals with the determination of optimum arrangement of manufacturing facilities with respect to different layout patterns. A two-dimensional layout is an arrangement fashion in which the manufacturing facilities are laid in a planar area. In this paper, a mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical programming model is proposed for determining the optimum layout of machines in a two-dimensional area. The parameters considered by the proposed model are (a) production capacity of machines, (b) multiple machines of each type (machine redundancy), (c) processing route of parts, (d) dimensions of machines. A technique is used to linearize the formulated nonlinear model. An algorithm based on branch-and-bound approach is proposed to obtain the optimal solution of the proposed mathematical programming model. A simple illustrative example is discussed to demonstrate the technique, and then small-, medium-, and large-sized problems are solved. Comparison of the layout obtained from the proposed model indicates that the proposed model considerably reduces the total distance traveled by products as compared to an optimum process layout configuration for small- and medium-sized problems. The paper concludes that the proposed branch-and-bound approach performs inefficient for large-sized problems. For large-sized problems, the proposed mathematical programming model should be solved through meta-heuristics like genetic algorithms, tabu search, etc. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study questions the frequent overemphasis on population growth aspects of African urbanization with little consideration of the spatial extent by analyzing the influence of population growth on the spatial expansion of the Morogoro urban municipality (MUM) in Tanzania between 2000 and 2016. Shannon's Entropy, a random forest supervised classifier, and spatial analysis were adopted to analyze Multi-temporal Landsat images obtained through the Google Earth Engine platform to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution and pattern of land-use change. Findings from this research show that Shannon's entropy values for MUM increased from 0.522 in 2000, to 0.761 in 2007, and to 0.901 in 2016 with the urban land cover recording a considerable and consistent increase. Similarly, the municipality's annual rate of change in population decreased from 4.17{\%} in 1967 to 3.81{\%} in 2016, and is estimated to rise to 4.54{\%} by 2030 with a corresponding population of 25,262 in 1967 and 622,000 in 2016. From the results, the rate of population growth is not commensurate with the rate of spatial expansion, as the spatial extent is more than twice the population growth. An important contribution from this research relates to the limited attention to the faster rate of urban expansion compared to population growth in African cities; a situation that is inconsistent with sustainable and resilient urban futures. It is recommended that municipal authorities should consider initiatives (e.g., environmental planning models) to reverse the current trend of urban growth in order to improve the health, density, sustainability and resilience of the urban environment.},

An analysis of sustainable initiatives (n = 29) shows a clear prioritisation of urban morphology on individual livability at the expense of participatory governance and sutainability awareness, especially for large projects promoted by private developers. A co-occurrence analysis suggests that smaller projects manage to integrate more sutainability aspects.

If multiple resources are involved, each resource can be considered a niche , and each subpopulation exploiting a niche can be considered a species . By treating population slots as a nite resource, we obtain the traditional, xed-size population simple GA . By further treating the gure of merit (i.e., the function to be optimized) as a limited resource, we obtain tness sharing. If our problem domain manifests explicit resources, such as rewards for correct classi cation of examples, we can enforce resource sharing. Both tness and resource sharing have been studied separately, and usually under the as- sumption of non-overlapping niches, or perfect sharing . Little e ort has been made to under- stand the more complicated situation of niche overlap. Yet the resolution of niche overlap is critical to successful, useful niching. Non-overlapping niches can be covered by non-competing species, while heavily overlapped niches induce competition between species in which only the best will survive to represent the overlapping resources. Somewhere in between the two ex- tremes of overlap must lie a critical boundary between cooperation (all species survive) and competition (one dominant species survives). We seek this boundary for the simplest case of niche overlap: two niches. We rst de ne the general mechanism of sharing, and investigate where sharing-induced- niching ts into the larger frameworks of context-dependent function optimization, natural ecologies, and models of cooperation and competition. We then map tness sharing to resource sharing, and show that they are identical when there is no niche overlap (i.e., perfect sharing). We go on to analyze the three cases: perfect sharing, tness sharing (with overlap) and resource sharing (with overlap). We nd that even under severe selective pressure with high degrees of niche overlap, a stable equilibrium population is quickly found and inde nitely maintained, a population consisting of diverse species covering the best niches. We nd that maintenance of the sharing equilibrium degrades gradually as niche overlap and tness discrepancies increase. We create a control map for the two-niche case, plotting the boundary between surviving niche pairs (cooperation) and untenable niche pairs (competition). Controlling this boundary will allow us to use sharing to evolve the types of cooperation and competition appropriate to the problem at hand. We extend the above analysis by looking at some aspects of the general case of multiple overlapping niches. We discover that calculating the equilibrium point for three or more niches under resource sharing can be computationally expensive, as evidenced by the diculty that GA selection has in reaching it. We present some evidence that equilibrium can thus represent solutions to hard problems, and that selection plus sharing might be a computationally intensive yet ecient algorithm (even without the exploration operators of recombination and mutation). In addition to analyzing the existence, resilience, nature, and meaning of sharing equi- librium, we also explore its utility. We apply various sharing methods to speci c problems from three domains: function optimization (search), multi-objective optimization, and lay- out/packing problems. We nd that sharing is a robust, exible, and extensible technique, whose simplicity and similarity with nature give us further con dence in its general applica- bility. We hope our results ameliorate some of the over-reaching criticisms frequently used to dismiss sharing as a niching method, by demonstrating that sharing is not computationally expensive, that its performance degrades gracefully with decreasing a priori knowledge of niche distribution, and that simple and intuitive techniques can be found to extend sharing's domain of utility.},

abstract = {Facility layout problems (FLP) involve determining the optimal placement of machines within a fixed space. An effective layout minimises costs. The total material travel distance is a key indicator of the efficiency of internal logistics. Changes in demand and product mix may alter the material flow. The dynamic facilities layout problem (DFLP) takes into account changes in demand and allows for the periodic redesign of facilities. Facility redesign may reduce the material flow cost, but there is a trade-off between material flow improvements and reorganisation costs. There is a limited literature on the redesign of facilities with stochastic demand, heterogeneous-sized resources and rectilinear material flow. The Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) has been used to successfully solve a range of engineering problems, but it has not previously been used to solve operations management problems or the FLP. This paper outlines novel modified Backtracking Search Algorithms (mBSAs) that solved the stochastic DFLP with heterogeneous sized resources. The combination of material flow and redesign costs were minimised. Three mBSA were benchmarked against the classical BSA and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using 11 benchmark datasets obtained from the literature. The best mBSA generated better solutions than the GA for large-size problems. The total costs for the layouts generated by the best mBSA were significantly lower than for the conventional BSA. The modifications to the BSA increased the diversity of candidate solutions, which increased the amount of exploration. The computational time required by the three mBSAs was up to 70{\%} less than the GA.},

@article{Vulevic2018,
abstract = {This study analyses the possibilities for optimal land use structure in mountainous areas of rural Serbia, which is faced with problems such as unfavorable terrain characteristics and inadequate land use patterns causing economic underdevelopment and increasing population migration. In the case of a small privately owned farm in Western Serbia, optimal land use pattern is determined using the linear programming model. The objective function-cost-effectiveness or soil erosion reduction, as well as constraints, are formulated using the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for a 15-year production period and soil losses data calculated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The best results are achieved using the scenario with the aim to minimize soil erosion, considering the BCR in the constraints. This scenario is proposed since it was registered that the benefit for landowners would increase by five times, while the losses of land would decline about 80{\%}. The sensitivity analysis of investments is performed to check whether the price variation affects the cost-effectiveness of proposed land use. Results show that market changes (nine cases are considered) do not lead to significant changes in land use allocation. Proposed land use pattern improves the environmental condition, strengthens the rural economy and thus offers the greatest potential for sustainable development of mountainous rural areas.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new model of facility location problem referred to as k-product uncapacitated facility location problem with multi-type clients. The k-product uncapacitated facility location problem with multi- type clients consists of two set of sites, one is the set of demand points where clients are located and the other is the set of sites where facilities of unlimited capacities can be set up to serve the clients. Each facility can provide only one kind of products. Each client needs to be served by a set of facilities depending on which products it needs. Each facility can be set up only for one of the k products with a non-negative fixed cost determined by the product it is designated to provide. There is also a nonnegative cost of shipping goods between each pair of locations. The problem is to determine the set of facilities to be set up and to find an assignment of each client to a set of facilities so that the sum of the setup costs and the shipping costs is minimized. Under the assumption that the setting costs is zero and the shipping costs are in facilities centered metric space, it is shown that the problem with two kinds of clients is NP-complete. Furthermore a heuristic algorithm with worst case performance ratio not more than 2-1/k is presented for any integer k.},

Eight different combinations of control parameters of binary coded GA were tested in a hypothetical building problem by changing 80 variables. The results showed that GA performance was insensitive to some GA control parameter values such as crossover probability and mutation rate. However, population size was the most influential control parameter on the GA performance. In particular, the population sizes (15 individuals) require less computational time to reach the optimum solution. In particular, a binary encoded GA with relatively small population sizes can be used to solve constrained building optimization problems within 750 building simulation calls.},

abstract = {Plant layout design is a complex task requiring a wealth of engineering experience. A well-designed layout can extraordinarily reduce various costs, so layout study is of great value. To promote the research depth, plenty of considerations have been taken. However, an actual plant may have several frames and how to distribute facilities and determine the location of them in the didierent frames has not been well studied. In this work, frames are set as a special kind of inner structure and are added into the model to assign facilities into several blocks. A quantitative method for assigning facilities is proposed to let the number of cross-frame connections be minimized. After allocating the facilities into several blocks, each frame is optimized to obtain initial frame results. With designer decisions and cross-frame flow information, the relative locations of frames are determined and then the internal frame layouts are optimized again to reach the coupling optimization between frame and plant layout. Minimizing the total cost involving investment and operating costs is set to be the objective. In the case study, a plant with 138 facilities and 247 material connections is studied. All the facilities are assigned into four frames, and only 17 connections are left to be cross-frame ones. Through the two optimizations of each frame, the length of cross-frame connections reduces by 582.7 m, and the total cost decreases by 4.7 x 105 ¥/a. Through these steps, the idea of frame is successfully applied and the ediectiveness of the proposed methodology is proved.},
