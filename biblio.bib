@article{Aggarwal2001,
abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

The development of sound joints between materials is of great importance in FSW. One of the most challengin problems in choosing appropriate welding parameters in order to produce sound joint. Traditionally, a time-consuming trial and error development was carried out to dewtermine welding parameters. Additionally, an optimized welding parameters combinataion was not achieved, because welds can be fabricated with very different ideal welding parameters. Different optimization techniques can be employed to determinethe optimized output parameters by specifying the relation between the input and output variables. Applications of optimization methods in FSW are explained, and basic principles of these methods, such as Taguchi, genetic optimization, and multi-objective optimzation methods, are described.},

As there are conflicting criteria's according to LEED and BREAM sustainable site parameters, local regulations and local climate conditions, an efficient decision support system can be developed by the help of Pareto based non-dominated genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) which is used for several possibly conflicting objectives that need to be considered together.

In traditional network planning, the final decision of BTS placement is taken by a team of radio planners, this decision is not fool proof against regulatory requirements. In this paper, an intelligent based algorithm for optimal BTS site placement has been proposed. The proposed technique takes into consideration neighbour and regulation considerations objectively while determining cell site. The application will lead to a quantitatively unbiased evaluated decision making process in BTS placement. An experimental data of a 2km by 3km territory was simulated for testing the new algorithm, results obtained show a 100{\%} performance of the neighbour constrained algorithm in BTS placement optimization.

However, the analysis of why and how risks should be taken into account does not seem to be considered as a global question by researchers, who have mostly focused on specific problems, such as stochasticity or uncertainty. The aim of this article is to point out the importance of risk management and control at a more global level during the design of production systems. More particularly, we discuss opportunities to design facility layout solutions that contribute to avoid, prevent, or reduce certain types of industrial risks taken in the broad sense (flow risks, reliability risks, quality risks, safety risks, environment risks, etc.). We discuss the kinds of risks that such facility layout solutions would allow considering. We address the issue of how to represent risks so that they could be taken into account, and we review existing academic and industrial approaches that are close to this topic. We show that approaching risks with facility layout solutions is a promising research direction that is worth more investigation. {\textcopyright} IEOM Society International.},

abstract = {This work proposes a new methodology and mathematical formulation to address the facility layout problem.The goal is to minimise the total material handling cost subjected to production-derived constraints. This cost is a function of the distance that the products should cover within the facility. The first idea is to use the A ∗ algorithm to identify the distances between workstations in a more realistic way. A ∗ determines the shortest path within the facility that contains obstacles and transportation routes. The second idea is to combine a genetic algorithm and the A ∗ algorithm with a homogenous methodology to improve the quality of the facility layouts. In an iterative way, the layout solution space is explored using the genetic algorithm. We study the impacts of the appropriate crossover and mutation operators and the values of the parameters used in this algorithm on the cost of the proposed arrangements. These operators and parameter values are fine-tuned using Monte Carlo simulations. The facility arrangements are all compared and discussed based on their material handling cost associated with the Euclidean distance, rectilinear distance, and A ∗ algorithm. Finally, we present a set of conclusions regarding the suggested methodology and discuss our future research goals.},

abstract = {Today, the concept of open plan is more and more widely accepted that many companies have switched to open-plan offices. Their design is an issue in the scope of space layout planning. Although there are many professional architectural layout design software in the market, in the real life, office designers seldom use these tools because their license fees are usually expensive and using them to solve an open-plan office design is like using an overly powerful and expensive tool to fix a minor problem. Therefore, manual drafting through a trial and error process is most often used. This article attempts to propose a lightweight tool to automate open-plan office layout generation using a nested genetic algorithm optimization with two layers, where the inner layer algorithm is embedded in the outer one. The result is enhanced by a local search. The main objective is to maximize space utilization by maximizing the size of the open workspace. This approach is different from its precedents, in that the location search is conducted on a grid map rather than several pre-selected candidate locations. Consequently, the generated layout design presents a less rigid workstation arrangement, inviting a casual and unrestrictive work environment. The real potential of the approach is reflected in the productivity of test fits. Automating and simplifying the generation of layouts for test fits can tremendously decrease the amount of time and resources required to generate them. The experimental case study shows that the developed approach is powerful and effective, making it a totally automated process.},

EASE comprises a novel sub-heuristic that constructs valid spatial layouts, a mathematical framework to quantify the satisfaction of constraints, and evolutionary operators to improve alternative layouts' fitness. We test EASE on the design of a library building. We evaluate EASE's performance for different building forms and different evolutionary algorithm parameters.

abstract = {Layout problems are found in several types of manufacturing systems. Typically, layout problems are related to the location of facilities (e.g., machines, departments) in a plant. They are known to greatly impact the system performance. Most of these problems are NP hard. Numerous research works related to facility layout have been published. A few literature reviews exist, but they are not recent or are restricted to certain specific aspects of these problems. The literature analysis given here is recent and not restricted to specific considerations about layout design. We suggest a general framework to analyze the literature and present existing works using such criteria as: the manufacturing system features, static/dynamic considerations, continual/discrete representation, problem formulation, and resolution approach.

In this paper, we examine several of these diversity-maintaining mechanisms, including a new one, incest prevention. We argue that by adopting a conservative selection strategy, elitist selection, the theoretical objection to these various mechanisms for combating premature convergence no longer applies. Finally, we present the results of an empirical study which suggests that these mechanisms, and especially incest prevention, are effective in preventing premature convergence, thereby significantly improving search.},

abstract = {The dynamic construction site layout planning (DCSLP) problem refers to the efficient placement and relocation of temporary construction facilities within a dynamically changing construction site environment considering the characteristics of facilities and work interrelationships, the shape and topography of the construction site, and the time-varying project needs. A multi-objective dynamic optimization model is developed for this problem that considers construction and relocation costs of facilities, transportation costs of resources moving from one facility to another or to workplaces, as well as safety and environmental considerations resulting from facilities' operations and interconnections. The latter considerations are taken into account in the form of preferences or constraints regarding the proximity or remoteness of particular facilities to other facilities or work areas. The analysis of multiple project phases and the dynamic facility relocation from phase to phase highly increases the problem size, which, even in its static form, falls within the NP (for Nondeterministic Polynomial time)-hard class of combinatorial optimization problems. For this reason, a genetic algorithm has been implemented for the solution due to its capability to robustly search within a large solution space. Several case studies and operational scenarios have been implemented through the Palisade's Evolver software for model testing and evaluation. The results indicate satisfactory model response to time-varying input data in terms of solution quality and computation time. The model can provide decision support to site managers, allowing them to examine alternative scenarios and fine-tune optimal solutions according to their experience by introducing desirable preferences or constraints in the decision process.},

abstract = {The Unequal Area Facility Layout Problem (UA-FLP) is a relevant optimization problem related to industrial design, that deals with obtaining the most effective allocation of facilities, that make up the rectangular manufacturing plant layout. The UA-FLP is known to be a hard optimization problem, where meta-heuristic approaches are a good option to obtain competitive solutions. Many of these computational approaches, however, usually fall into local optima, and suffer from lack of diversity in their population, mainly due to the huge search spaces and hard fitness landscapes produced by the traditional representation of UA-FLP. To solve these issues, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid meta-heuristic approach, which combines a Coral Reefs Optimization algorithm (CRO) with a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and a new representation for the problem, called Relaxed Flexible Bay Structure (RFBS), which simplifies the encoding and makes its fitness landscape more affordable. Thus, the use of VNS allows more intensive exploitation of the searching space with an affordable computational cost, as well as the RFBS allows better management of the free space into the plant layout. This combined strategy has been tested over a set of UA-FLP instances of different sizes, which have been previously tackled in the literature with alternative meta-heuristics. The tests results show very good performance in all cases.},

abstract = {The unequal area facility layout problem (UA-FLP) has been addressed by many methods. Most of them only take aspects that can be quantified into account. This contribution presents a novel approach, which considers both quantitative aspects and subjective features. To this end, a multi-objective interactive genetic algorithm is proposed with the aim of allowing interaction between the algorithm and the human expert designer, normally called the decision maker (DM) in the field of UA-FLP. The contribution of the DM's knowledge into the approach guides the complex search process, adjusting it to the DM's preferences. The entire population associated to facility layout designs is evaluated by quantitative criteria in combination with an assessment prepared by the DM, who gives a subjective evaluation for a set of representative individuals of the population in each iteration. In order to choose these individuals, a soft computing clustering method is used. Two interesting real-world data sets are analysed to empirically probe the robustness of these models. The first UA-FLP case study describes an ovine slaughterhouse plant and the second, a design for recycling carton plant. Relevant results are obtained, and interesting conclusions are drawn from the application of this novel intelligent framework.},

abstract = {A central challenge to evolutionary computation is enabling techniques to evolve increasingly complex target end products. Frequently, direct approaches that reward only the target end product itself are not successful because the path between the starting conditions and the target end product traverses through a complex fitness landscape, where the directly accessible intermediary states may be require deleterious or even simply neutral mutations. As such, a host of techniques have sprung up to support evolutionary computation techniques taking these paths. One technique is scaffolding where intermediary targets are used to provide a path from the starting state to the end state. While scaffolding can be successful within well-understood domains it also poses the challenge of identifying useful intermediaries. Within this paper we first identify some shortcomings of scaffolding approaches ' namely, that poorly selected intermediaries may in fact hurt the evolutionary computation's chance of producing the desired target end product. We then describe a light-weight approach to selecting intermediate scaffolding states that improve the efficacy of the evolutionary computation.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithm (GA) is an artificial intelligence search method that uses the process of evolution and natural selection theory and is under the umbrella of evolutionary computing algorithm. It is an efficient tool for solving optimization problems. Integration among (GA) parameters is vital for successful (GA) search. Such parameters include mutation and crossover rates in addition to population that are important issues in (GA). However, each operator of GA has a special and different influence. The impact of these factors is influenced by their probabilities; it is difficult to predefine specific ratios for each parameter, particularly, mutation and crossover operators. This paper reviews various methods for choosing mutation and crossover ratios in GAs. Next, we define new deterministic control approaches for crossover and mutation rates, namely Dynamic Decreasing of high mutation ratio/dynamic increasing of low crossover ratio (DHM/ILC), and Dynamic Increasing of Low Mutation/Dynamic Decreasing of High Crossover (ILM/DHC). The dynamic nature of the proposed methods allows the ratios of both crossover and mutation operators to be changed linearly during the search progress, where (DHM/ILC) starts with 100{\%} ratio for mutations, and 0{\%} for crossovers. Both mutation and crossover ratios start to decrease and increase, respectively. By the end of the search process, the ratios will be 0{\%} for mutations and 100{\%} for crossovers. (ILM/DHC) worked the same but the other way around. The proposed approach was compared with two parameters tuning methods (predefined), namely fifty-fifty crossover/mutation ratios, and the most common approach that uses static ratios such as (0.03) mutation rates and (0.9) crossover rates. The experiments were conducted on ten Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP). The experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed (DHM/ILC) when dealing with small population size, while the proposed (ILM/DHC) was found to be more effective when using large population size. In fact, both proposed dynamic methods outperformed the predefined methods compared in most cases tested.},

While most other linear mixed-integer models available in the literature have been obtained through a linearization of the quadratic assignment problem, the ones presented in this paper are not. The continuous models have an even more compact form. An advantage of the formulations presented in this paper is that the location of sites need not be known a priori. More importantly, two of the formulations model the layout problem with facilities of unequal area. Solving the models presented with an unconstrained optimization algorithm yields good quality suboptimal solutions in a relatively low computation time.

abstract = {Many of the existing healthcare facilities face resource restrictions in reallocating of departments or expanding in space and infrastructure, which is a key requirement for providing proper services. The purpose of this research paper is to present a user-friendly Two-stage method using exchange heuristics techniques that finds improved solutions to the existing healthcare multi-floor facility layour problem. The First stage is an assignment Hungarian method that re-assigns departments to floors reducing the total of the departmental interaction costs between vertical floors is minimized. The Second stage uses the Craft algorithm that solves the layout of each floor independently of the other floors, the two stages are simulated using Microsoft Excel and it is clear that the proposed method can provide several improved layouts for medium and large-scale problem events.},

Since this problem is validated as an NP-complete problem, exact method cannot find the best solution in particular for the medium and large-scale problems. Several researches have been conducted for solving this problem using metaheuristics. However, new meta-heuristics may lead to more accurate solutions in less computational time. In this research, two new meta-heuristics called CBO and ECBO have been employed to solve construction site layout problem. Results show that both of them have capability of solving this kind of problem. Two case examples are solved to show the applicability and performance of the proposed methods.},

Safe site selection (SSS) largely depends upon compiling, analyzing, and refining the information of an area where a building is likely to be located. The locational and topographical aspects of an area located in hilly regions play a major role in SSS, but are generally neglected in traditional and CAD-based systems used for site selection. Architects and engineers select a site based on their judgment, knowledge, and experience, but issues related to site safety are generally ignored. This study reviewed the existing literature on site selection techniques, building codes, and approaches of existing standards to identify various aspects crucial for SSS in hilly regions. A questionnaire survey was conducted to identify various aspects that construction professionals consider critical for SSS. This study explored the application of geographic information systems (GIS) in modeling the locational and topographical aspects to identify areas of suitability. A GIS-based methodology for locating a safe site that satisfies various spatial safety aspects was developed.},

With the growth of population in Hong Kong, there is a need to develop some new residential areas continuously and to decentralize population in the outlying areas such as the satellite towns and/or new towns. The land use planning consists of identifying and selecting potential development areas to meet the expected land requirements. The optimal land use development problem relates to the allocation of population with optimal objective function value. In this case the land production cost includes formation of new areas, construction of public works infrastructure, and provision of other utility services. The optimal land use development plan is chosen from a large number of potential development areas and potential population allocation. This problem can be formulated as a 0-1 programming problem mathematically. In this paper, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the 0-1 programming problem in which some new land use plans are identified in Hong Kong so as to minimise the total development and transportation cost. It is the first work to apply genetic algorithm for land use problem in practice. The developed model will advance this subject and help the authorities decide which new residential areas should be considered for detailed investigation.

Urban layout is very important for the development of urban transportation and building system. Once the layout of the city is finalized, it will be difficult to start again. Therefore, the urban architectural layout planning and design have a very important impact. This paper uses the urban architecture layout big data for building layout optimization using advanced computation techniques. Firstly, a big data collection and storage system based on the Hadoop platform is established. Then, the evaluation model of urban building planning based on improved logit and PSO algorithm is established. The PSO algorithm is used to find the suitable area for this kind of building layout, and then through five impact indicators: land prices, rail transit, historical protection, road traffic capacity, and commercial potential have been established by using the following logit linear regression model. Then, the bridge between logit and PSO algorithm is established by the fitness value of particle. The particle in the particle swarm is assigned to the index parameter of logit model, and then the logit model in the evaluation system is run. The performance index corresponding to the set of parameters is obtained. The performance index is passed to the PSO as the fitness value of the particle to search for the best adaptive position. The reasonable degree of regional architectural planning is obtained, and the rationality of urban architectural planning layout is determined.},

abstract = {The facility layout problem (FLP) is the problem of placing facilities in a certain shop floor so that facilities do not overlap each other and are satisfied with some given objectives. Considering practical situations, this study focuses on the multi-objective unequal-area facility layout problem (UA-FLP), where the facilities have unequal-areas and fixed shapes and are placed orthogonally in the continuous shop floor. The objectives of the problem aim to optimize the material handling cost, the total adjacency value and the utilization ratio of the shop floor. The chief difficulties of this version of the FLP lie in the satisfaction of non-overlapping constraint between any two different facilities and the optimization of multiple objectives in the huge solution space. In this paper, we put forward a heuristic configuration mutation operation and subsequent local search based on the gradient method to satisfy the non-overlapping constraint, and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, which has recently proven its high effectiveness and robustness in solving multi-objective problems, to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions of the problem. The novelty of the paper lies in the use of an objective space division method in the MOPSO which governs the neighborhood topology and the local best swarm used to assess the global fitness of a solution and choose the global leader particle. The proposed algorithm is tested on three sets of different UA-FLPs from the literature with the size of the problem up to 62 facilities. The numerical results show that the proposed method is effective in solving the multi-objective UA-FLP.},

Therefore, this paper considers the problem of arranging and rearranging (when there are changes between the flows of materials between departments) manufacturing facilities such that the sum of the material handling and rearrangement costs is minimized. This problem is known as the dynamic facility layout problem (DFLP). In this paper, two simulated annealing (SA) heuristics are developed for the DFLP. The first SA heuristic (SA I) is a direct adaptation of SA to the DFLP. The second SA heuristic (SA II) is the same as SA I with a look-ahead/look-back strategy added. To test the performance of the heuristics, a data set taken from the literature is used in the analysis.

The facility layout problem is highly combinatorial in nature and generally exhibits many local minima. These properties make it a suitable candidate for simulated annealing. Using a new candidate layout generation routine and spacefilling curves, we develop an improvement-type layout algorithm based on simulated annealing that considers an expanded set of department exchanges. The resulting algorithm achieves low-cost solutions that are much less dependent on the initial layout than other approaches. We compare the performance of the simulated-annealing based algorithm with both steepest-descent and randomized approaches from the literature. Unlike other simulated annealing papers which typically present a statistical experiment to evaluate the effect of numerous control settings, all the experiments presented in this paper were conducted with control settings that are constant or easily specified. This approach facilitates the application of the proposed algorithm to real-life facility layout problems in both single and multiple floor facilities.

abstract = {Facility layout problem is one of the most important problems in a huge range of industries and services organizations. Simultaneous study of some qualitative and quantitative parameters like closeness relationship between facilities, physical constraints such as input/output points and how to arrange facilities can play a key role to determine the facility layout. Considering these parameters can lead to reduce production costs, increase production capacity, and remove additional displacements. A two-stage approach is proposed to achieve these goals. In the first stage, a goal programming model is proposed to determine weights of the attributes based on the experts' opinions with different preference representation structures. Afterwards, the closeness ratings of the facilities are calculated using weights of attributes. In the second stage, an efficient layout is designed by determining facilities placement sequence, location of the next facility adjacent to the previous one, location of input/output points, and rectilinear feasible shortest path between facilities. Two meta-heuristic algorithms including particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm are designed due to computational complexity. The objective function is to minimize the sum of products distance between facilities and closeness rating and also to minimize the dead space. A case study of an Auto Body Parts company is demonstrated to verify the efficiency of the proposed two-stage approach. Furthermore, in order to assess the performance of the proposed approach, a comparison is drawn between the proposed approach and five existing approaches in the literature to solve different problems by using the two meta-heuristic algorithms.},

Increasing number of physical structures result in failure to meet students' requirements for open space. Nevertheless, university campuses should ensure that students who do not know each other get to know each other and get used to the environment to which they are strangers by providing students with common living spaces. For this reason, it was considered to re-design an outdoor area (festival area) in Karadeniz technical university campus, where students can perform their extracurricular activities and increase their social relations with one another. As a result of the literature review, it was seen that most of the studies are either carried out only to design successful outdoor spaces for the needs of the users or the spaces designed by other people are assessed after use. Consequently, it was determined that there are certain deficits in determining whether the spaces designed in line with the decisions made by the researcher fulfil user needs. For this reason, it was aimed in this study to make the post-use evaluation of the production process after the outdoor design process of a campus outdoor space is completed by the researcher. The present study was conducted in Kanuni Park (festival area) in main campus of Karadeniz Technical University, which is currently used as a parking lot only and sometimes used as a concert venue at certain times of the year. The objective of the study was to realize spatial organization of the said study area so that it meets the students' needs and requirements, serves as a space where various activities take place, and provides facilities for a variety of uses (affordance) on a continuous basis, rather than at certain times of the year. Therefore, programming/design/construction/occupancy/post occupancy evaluation processes which comprise spatial development process were performed within Kanuni Park and such processes were evaluated.},

abstract = {The optimal solution to any facility layout problem is an important aspect and a major concern as it involves significant material handling and transportation cost. The objective is to arrange the departments within the predefined facility boundaries in the way that the interaction between the functions is efficient and the overall movement cost is minimized. While facility layout problems have traditionally focused on manufacturing facilities, there has been little work on analyzing layouts for hospitals. The thesis focuses on hospital facility layout problems (HLP) to (i) minimize the movements of patients and (ii) minimize the movements of accompanying resources such as doctors, nurses, equipment and paramedical staff. The thesis consists of two sections. In the first section, a model for the multi-floor layout problem is presented based on the minimization of movement cost. The model has travel frequency or number of trips, trip diffculty rating, baseline travel cost and distance as parameters for determining the movement cost. In the second section, some additional parameters and constraints are imposed on the model and it is simulated using Microsoft Excel. Simulations are also run to study the effect of different proposed strategies on movement cost. These proposed strategies show a reduction in movement cost from the sample layout strategy in section one. A representative example is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed formulation.},

abstract = {The performance of structures and infrastructure under natural hazards can have a significant impact on the sustainability of the system, often characterized in terms of environmental, economic, or social indicators of performance. This paper commences with a brief review of the relation of natural hazard performance to sustainability and an assessment of bridge infrastructure sustainability with an emphasis on environmental indicators. A framework for life cycle sustainability analysis (LCS-A) is then posed that elucidates the role of natural hazard risks when evaluating sustainable bridge performance using risk-based indicators of environmental sustainability, including embodied energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Its application provides insight on the sustainability of mitigating damage from natural hazards through retrofitting deficient structures, considering uncertainty in the hazard occurrence, structural performance, and repair or reconstruction actions that affect energy expenditure and emissions. A case study is presented to evaluate indicators of environmental sustainability for individual bridges and for a regional portfolio of bridges susceptible to aging and seismic hazards. The results show the significant impact that retrofit can have on reducing the expected value of emissions and embodied energy from lifetime hazard exposure. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {We address the Unequal-Area Facility-Layout Problem (UA-FLP), which aims to dimension and locate rectangular facilities in an unlimited floor space, without overlap, while minimizing the sum of distances among facilities weighted by “material-handling” flows. We introduce two algorithmic approaches to address this problem: a basic Genetic Algorithm (GA), and a GA combined with a decomposition strategy via partial solution deconstructions and reconstructions. To efficiently decompose the problem, we impose a solution structure where no facility should cross the X or Y axis. Although this restriction can possibly deteriorate the value of the best achievable solution, it also greatly enhances the search capabilities of the method on medium and large problem instances. For most such instances, current exact methods are impracticable. As highlighted by our experiments, the resulting algorithm produces solutions of high quality for the two classic datasets of the literature, improving six out of the eight best known solutions from the first set, with up to 125 facilities, and all medium- and large-scale instances from the second set. For some of the largest instances of the second set, with 90 or 100 facilities, the average solution improvement goes as high as 6 percent or 7 percent when compared to previous algorithms, in less CPU time. We finally introduce additional instances with up to 150 facilities. On this benchmark, the decomposition method provides an average solution improvement with respect to the basic GA of about 9 percent and 1.3 percent on short and long runs, respectively.},

abstract = {This paper surveys strategies applied to avoid premature convergence in Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Genetic Algorithm belongs to the set of nature inspired algorithms. The applications of GA cover wide domains such as optimization, pattern recognition, learning, scheduling, economics, bioinformatics, etc. Fitness function is the measure of GA, distributed randomly in the population. Typically, the particular value for each gene start dominating as the search evolves. During the evolutionary search, fitness decreases as the population converges, this leads to the problems of the premature convergence and slow finishing. In this paper, a detailed and comprehensive survey of different approaches implemented to prevent premature convergence with their strengths and weaknesses is presented. This paper also discusses the details about GA, factors affecting the performance during the search for global optima and brief details about the theoretical framework of Genetic algorithm. The surveyed research is organized in a systematic order. A detailed summary and analysis of reviewed literature are given for the quick review. A comparison of reviewed literature has been made based on different parameters. The underlying motivation for this paper is to identify methods that allow the development of new strategies to prevent premature convergence and the effective utilization of genetic algorithms in the different area of research.},

abstract = {Efficient layout planning of a construction site is fundamental for successful project undertaking as it enhances both productivity and safety in construction sites. This task usually consists of identifying the temporary facilities needed to support construction operations, determining their size and shape, and optimally positioning them in the unoccupied areas within the site boundaries. The site layout planning problem is a complex combinatorial optimization problem involving multiple objectives and it grows significantly in size as the number of facilities and constraints increases. The existing literature includes a variety of analytical, heuristic, and meta-heuristic techniques for solving the problem but existing studies usually examine a small number of facilities and focus on travel distance minimization, ignoring generally cost related or other decision parameters. The objective of this study is to develop feasible and efficient site layout solutions in a realistic representation scheme taking into consideration not only the total distance traveled but also cost and safety parameters as well. A multi-objective optimization model is developed aiming at minimizing a generalized cost function which results from the construction cost of a facility placed at alternative locations, the transportation cost among locations, and any safety concern in the form of preferred proximity or remoteness of particular facilities to other facilities or work areas. The development integrates the required robust search objective with the optimization capabilities of the genetic algorithms (GAs). The model has been tested on several test cases and the results of a comparative study with existing methods from the literature are presented. The evaluation indicates that the proposed model provides effective and rational solutions, in response to decision parameters and problem constraints, and that it results in more robust layout planning than previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

Monte Carlo simulation method is used to randomly generate different scenarios. A mathematical model is established to describe the dynamic facility layout problem with the consideration of transport device assignment. As a solution procedure for the proposed model, an improved adaptive genetic algorithm with population initialization strategy is developed to reduce the search space and improve the solving efficiency. Different sized instances are compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to verify the effectiveness of the proposed genetic algorithm.

abstract = {Due to inherent complexity of the dynamic facility layout problem, it has always been a challenging issue to develop a solution algorithm for this problem. For more than one decade, many researchers have proposed different algorithms for this problem. After reviewing the shortcomings of these algorithms, we realize that the performance can be further improved by a more intelligent search. This paper develops an effective novel hybrid multi-population genetic algorithm. Using a proposed heuristic procedure, we separate solution space into different parts and each subpopulation represents a separate part. This assures the diversity of the algorithm. Moreover, to intensify the search more and more, a powerful local search mechanism based on simulated annealing is developed. Unlike the available genetic operators previously proposed for this problem, we design the operators so as to search only the feasible space; thus, we save computational time by avoiding infeasible space. To evaluate the algorithm, we comprehensively discuss the parameter tuning of the algorithms by Taguchi method. The perfectly tuned algorithm is then compared with 11 available algorithms in the literature using well-known set of benchmark instances. Different analyses conducted on the results, show that the proposed algorithm enjoys the superiority and outperformance over the other algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report the results of our investigation of an evolutionary approach for solving the unequal area multi-objective facility layout problem (FLP) using the variable neighborhood search (VNS) with an adaptive scheme that presents the final layouts as a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. The unequal area FLP comprises a class of extremely difficult and widely applicable optimization problems arising in diverse areas and meeting the requirements for real-world applications. The VNS is an explorative local search method whose basic idea is systematic change of neighborhood within a local search. Traditionally, local search is applied to the solutions of each generation of an evolutionary algorithm, and has often been criticized for wasting computation time. To address these issues, the proposed approach is composed of the VNS with a modified 1-opt local search, an extended adaptive local search scheme for optimizing multiple objectives, and the multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA). Unlike conventional local search, the proposed adaptive local search scheme automatically determines whether the VNS is used in a GA loop or not. We investigate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison to multi-objective GA-based approaches without local search and augmented with traditional local search. The computational results indicate that the proposed approach with adaptive VNS is more efficient in most of the performance measures and can find near-optimal layouts by optimizing multiple criteria simultaneously. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, there are still some insuffciencies; indeed, one of the major problems usually as- sociated with the use of GAs is the premature convergence to solutions coding local optima of the objective function. The problem is tightly re- lated with the loss of genetic diversity of the GA's population, being the cause of a decrease on the quality of the solutions found. Out of question, this fact has lead to the development of different techniques aiming to solve, or at least to minimize the problem; traditional methods usually work to maintain a certain degree of genetic diversity on the target po- pulations, without affecting the convergence process of the GA.

abstract = {Facilities layout problem is one of the important issues affecting the productivity of manufacturing systems. This problem deals with the determination of optimum arrangement of manufacturing facilities with respect to different layout patterns. A two-dimensional layout is an arrangement fashion in which the manufacturing facilities are laid in a planar area. In this paper, a mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical programming model is proposed for determining the optimum layout of machines in a two-dimensional area. The parameters considered by the proposed model are (a) production capacity of machines, (b) multiple machines of each type (machine redundancy), (c) processing route of parts, (d) dimensions of machines. A technique is used to linearize the formulated nonlinear model. An algorithm based on branch-and-bound approach is proposed to obtain the optimal solution of the proposed mathematical programming model. A simple illustrative example is discussed to demonstrate the technique, and then small-, medium-, and large-sized problems are solved. Comparison of the layout obtained from the proposed model indicates that the proposed model considerably reduces the total distance traveled by products as compared to an optimum process layout configuration for small- and medium-sized problems. The paper concludes that the proposed branch-and-bound approach performs inefficient for large-sized problems. For large-sized problems, the proposed mathematical programming model should be solved through meta-heuristics like genetic algorithms, tabu search, etc. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Neverless, there have been a number of contradictory results concerning crossover operators with respect to overall performance. Recently, for example, genetic algorithms were used to design neural network modules and their control circuits. In these studies, a genedc algorithm without crossover outperformed a genetic algorithm with crossover. This report re-examines these studies, and concludes that the results were caused by a small population size. New results are presented that illustrate the effectiveness of crossover when the population size is larger. From a performance view, the results indicate that better neural networks can be evolved in a shorter time if the genetic algorithm uses crossover.},

abstract = {This study questions the frequent overemphasis on population growth aspects of African urbanization with little consideration of the spatial extent by analyzing the influence of population growth on the spatial expansion of the Morogoro urban municipality (MUM) in Tanzania between 2000 and 2016. Shannon's Entropy, a random forest supervised classifier, and spatial analysis were adopted to analyze Multi-temporal Landsat images obtained through the Google Earth Engine platform to quantify the spatial and temporal distribution and pattern of land-use change. Findings from this research show that Shannon's entropy values for MUM increased from 0.522 in 2000, to 0.761 in 2007, and to 0.901 in 2016 with the urban land cover recording a considerable and consistent increase. Similarly, the municipality's annual rate of change in population decreased from 4.17{\%} in 1967 to 3.81{\%} in 2016, and is estimated to rise to 4.54{\%} by 2030 with a corresponding population of 25,262 in 1967 and 622,000 in 2016. From the results, the rate of population growth is not commensurate with the rate of spatial expansion, as the spatial extent is more than twice the population growth. An important contribution from this research relates to the limited attention to the faster rate of urban expansion compared to population growth in African cities; a situation that is inconsistent with sustainable and resilient urban futures. It is recommended that municipal authorities should consider initiatives (e.g., environmental planning models) to reverse the current trend of urban growth in order to improve the health, density, sustainability and resilience of the urban environment.},

This study develops a framework ot characterise the gap between what is advocated as necessary for sustainable neighborhoods, and what is marketed as sustainable neighborhoods. A framework based on a sustainable neighborhood typology is developed using the Canadian province of Quebec as a case study. This is based on the main concepts underlying the four pillars of sustainability, but from a practical perspective. An analysis of sustainable initiatives (n = 29) shows a clear prioritisation of urban morphology on individual livability at the expense of participatory governance and sutainability awareness, especially for large projects promoted by private developers. A co-occurrence analysis suggests that smaller projects manage to integrate more sutainability aspects. The framework can be used to identify similarities and difference between development types for developing practical policy measures. This research highlights the importance involving public, and private stakeholders ath te early planning stage, in order to design more integrated projects.},

The proposed hybrid approach in this paper elegantly integrates the exploitation ability of VNS and exploration ability of GA. To examine the performance of the proposed hybrid approach, a set of instance problems have been used from the literature.

abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) with tness sharing have been analyzed and successfully applied to problems in search and optimization, while GAs using various types of resource sharing have been incorporated into classi ers, immune system models, arti cial ecologies, arti cial economies, etc. Both types of sharing are based on the same observation of nature: dividing a nite resource among competing organisms limits the size of populations dependent on that resource. If multiple resources are involved, each resource can be considered a niche , and each subpopulation exploiting a niche can be considered a species . By treating population slots as a nite resource, we obtain the traditional, xed-size population simple GA . By further treating the gure of merit (i.e., the function to be optimized) as a limited resource, we obtain tness sharing. If our problem domain manifests explicit resources, such as rewards for correct classi cation of examples, we can enforce resource sharing. Both tness and resource sharing have been studied separately, and usually under the as- sumption of non-overlapping niches, or perfect sharing . Little e ort has been made to under- stand the more complicated situation of niche overlap. Yet the resolution of niche overlap is critical to successful, useful niching. Non-overlapping niches can be covered by non-competing species, while heavily overlapped niches induce competition between species in which only the best will survive to represent the overlapping resources. Somewhere in between the two ex- tremes of overlap must lie a critical boundary between cooperation (all species survive) and competition (one dominant species survives). We seek this boundary for the simplest case of niche overlap: two niches. We rst de ne the general mechanism of sharing, and investigate where sharing-induced- niching ts into the larger frameworks of context-dependent function optimization, natural ecologies, and models of cooperation and competition. We then map tness sharing to resource sharing, and show that they are identical when there is no niche overlap (i.e., perfect sharing). We go on to analyze the three cases: perfect sharing, tness sharing (with overlap) and resource sharing (with overlap). We nd that even under severe selective pressure with high degrees of niche overlap, a stable equilibrium population is quickly found and inde nitely maintained, a population consisting of diverse species covering the best niches. We nd that maintenance of the sharing equilibrium degrades gradually as niche overlap and tness discrepancies increase. We create a control map for the two-niche case, plotting the boundary between surviving niche pairs (cooperation) and untenable niche pairs (competition). Controlling this boundary will allow us to use sharing to evolve the types of cooperation and competition appropriate to the problem at hand. We extend the above analysis by looking at some aspects of the general case of multiple overlapping niches. We discover that calculating the equilibrium point for three or more niches under resource sharing can be computationally expensive, as evidenced by the diculty that GA selection has in reaching it. We present some evidence that equilibrium can thus represent solutions to hard problems, and that selection plus sharing might be a computationally intensive yet ecient algorithm (even without the exploration operators of recombination and mutation). In addition to analyzing the existence, resilience, nature, and meaning of sharing equi- librium, we also explore its utility. We apply various sharing methods to speci c problems from three domains: function optimization (search), multi-objective optimization, and lay- out/packing problems. We nd that sharing is a robust, exible, and extensible technique, whose simplicity and similarity with nature give us further con dence in its general applica- bility. We hope our results ameliorate some of the over-reaching criticisms frequently used to dismiss sharing as a niching method, by demonstrating that sharing is not computationally expensive, that its performance degrades gracefully with decreasing a priori knowledge of niche distribution, and that simple and intuitive techniques can be found to extend sharing's domain of utility.},

abstract = {Facility layout problems (FLP) involve determining the optimal placement of machines within a fixed space. An effective layout minimises costs. The total material travel distance is a key indicator of the efficiency of internal logistics. Changes in demand and product mix may alter the material flow. The dynamic facilities layout problem (DFLP) takes into account changes in demand and allows for the periodic redesign of facilities. Facility redesign may reduce the material flow cost, but there is a trade-off between material flow improvements and reorganisation costs. There is a limited literature on the redesign of facilities with stochastic demand, heterogeneous-sized resources and rectilinear material flow. The Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) has been used to successfully solve a range of engineering problems, but it has not previously been used to solve operations management problems or the FLP. This paper outlines novel modified Backtracking Search Algorithms (mBSAs) that solved the stochastic DFLP with heterogeneous sized resources. The combination of material flow and redesign costs were minimised. Three mBSA were benchmarked against the classical BSA and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using 11 benchmark datasets obtained from the literature. The best mBSA generated better solutions than the GA for large-size problems. The total costs for the layouts generated by the best mBSA were significantly lower than for the conventional BSA. The modifications to the BSA increased the diversity of candidate solutions, which increased the amount of exploration. The computational time required by the three mBSAs was up to 70{\%} less than the GA.},

abstract = {This study analyses the possibilities for optimal land use structure in mountainous areas of rural Serbia, which is faced with problems such as unfavorable terrain characteristics and inadequate land use patterns causing economic underdevelopment and increasing population migration. In the case of a small privately owned farm in Western Serbia, optimal land use pattern is determined using the linear programming model. The objective function-cost-effectiveness or soil erosion reduction, as well as constraints, are formulated using the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for a 15-year production period and soil losses data calculated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The best results are achieved using the scenario with the aim to minimize soil erosion, considering the BCR in the constraints. This scenario is proposed since it was registered that the benefit for landowners would increase by five times, while the losses of land would decline about 80{\%}. The sensitivity analysis of investments is performed to check whether the price variation affects the cost-effectiveness of proposed land use. Results show that market changes (nine cases are considered) do not lead to significant changes in land use allocation. Proposed land use pattern improves the environmental condition, strengthens the rural economy and thus offers the greatest potential for sustainable development of mountainous rural areas.},

The k-product uncapacitated facility location problem with multi- type clients consists of two set of sites, one is the set of demand points where clients are located and the other is the set of sites where facilities of unlimited capacities can be set up to serve the clients. Each facility can provide only one kind of products. Each client needs to be served by a set of facilities depending on which products it needs. Each facility can be set up only for one of the k products with a non-negative fixed cost determined by the product it is designated to provide. There is also a nonnegative cost of shipping goods between each pair of locations. The problem is to determine the set of facilities to be set up and to find an assignment of each client to a set of facilities so that the sum of the setup costs and the shipping costs is minimized. Under the assumption that the setting costs is zero and the shipping costs are in facilities centered metric space, it is shown that the problem with two kinds of clients is NP-complete. Furthermore a heuristic algorithm with worst case performance ratio not more than 2-1/k is presented for any integer k.},

The results showed that GA performance was insensitive to some GA control parameter values such as crossover probability and mutation rate. However, population size was the most influential control parameter on the GA performance. In particular, the population sizes (15 individuals) require less computational time to reach the optimum solution. In particular, a binary encoded GA with relatively small population sizes can be used to solve constrained building optimization problems within 750 building simulation calls.},

abstract = {Plant layout design is a complex task requiring a wealth of engineering experience. A well-designed layout can extraordinarily reduce various costs, so layout study is of great value. To promote the research depth, plenty of considerations have been taken. However, an actual plant may have several frames and how to distribute facilities and determine the location of them in the didierent frames has not been well studied. In this work, frames are set as a special kind of inner structure and are added into the model to assign facilities into several blocks. A quantitative method for assigning facilities is proposed to let the number of cross-frame connections be minimized. After allocating the facilities into several blocks, each frame is optimized to obtain initial frame results. With designer decisions and cross-frame flow information, the relative locations of frames are determined and then the internal frame layouts are optimized again to reach the coupling optimization between frame and plant layout. Minimizing the total cost involving investment and operating costs is set to be the objective. In the case study, a plant with 138 facilities and 247 material connections is studied. All the facilities are assigned into four frames, and only 17 connections are left to be cross-frame ones. Through the two optimizations of each frame, the length of cross-frame connections reduces by 582.7 m, and the total cost decreases by 4.7 x 105 ¥/a. Through these steps, the idea of frame is successfully applied and the ediectiveness of the proposed methodology is proved.},

abstract = {A quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which is a combinatorial optimisation problem, is developed to model the problem of locating facilities with material flows between them. The aim of solving the QAP formulation for a facility layout problem (FLP) is to increase a system's operating efficiency by reducing material handling costs, which can be measured by interdepartmental distances and flows. The QAP-formulated FLP can be viewed as a discrete optimisation problem, where the quadratic objective function is optimised with respect to discrete decision variables subject to linear equality constraints. The conventional approach for solving this discrete optimisation problem is to use the linearisation of the quadratic objective function whereby additional discrete variables and constraints are introduced. The adoption of the linearisation process can result in a significantly increased number of variables and constraints; solving the resulting problem can therefore be challenging. In this paper, a new approach is introduced to solve this discrete optimisation problem. First, the discrete optimisation problem is transformed into an equivalent nonlinear optimisation problem involving only continuous decision variables by introducing quadratic inequality constraints. The number of variables, however, remains the same as the original problem. Then, an exact penalty function method is applied to convert this transformed continuous optimisation problem into an unconstrained continuous optimisation problem. An improved backtracking search algorithm is then developed to solve the unconstrained optimisation problem. Numerical computation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new approach.},

After presenting several practical applications of mixed integer programming, we describe the main classes of algorithms, branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut, that are used to solve this hard class of problems.

	abstract = {The computer game industry requires a skilled workforce and this combined with the complexity of modern games, means that production costs are extremely high. One of the most time consuming aspects is the creation of game geometry, the virtual world which the players inhabit. Procedural techniques have been used within computer graphics to create natural textures, simulate special effects and generate complex naural models including trees and waterfalls. It is these procedural techniques that we intend to harness to generate geometry and textures suitable for a game situated in an urban environment. Procedural techniques can provide many benefits for computer graphics applications when the correct algorithm is used. An overview of several commonly used procedural techniques including fractals, L-systems, Perlin noise, tiling systems and cellular basis is provided. The function of each technique and the resulting output they create are discussed to better understand their characteristics, benefits and relevance to the city generation problem. City generation is the creation of an urban area which necessitates the creation of buildings, situated along streets and arranged in appropriate patterns. Some research has already taken place into recreating road network patterns and generating buildings that can vary in function and architectural style. We will study the main body of existing research into procedural city generation and provide an overview of their implementations and a critique of their functionality and results. Finally we present areas in which further research into the generation of cities is required and outline our research goals for city generation.},

In the basic version, the ear with smallest interior angle is always selected to be cut in order to create fewer sliver triangles. To reduce sliver triangles in further, a bound of angle is set to determine whether a newly formed triangle has sharp angles, and edge swapping is accepted when the triangle is sharp. To apply the two algorithms on polygons with holes, 'Bridge' edges are created to transform a polygon with holes to a degenerate polygon which can be triangulated by the two algorithms. Applications show that the basic algorithm can avoid creating sliver triangles and obtain better triangulations than the traditional ear-clipping algorithm, and the improved algorithm can in further reduce sliver triangles effectively. Both of the algorithms run in O(n 2) time and O(n) space. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Results indicate that the grandparent based genetic repair strategy outperforms the parent alternative. Within this framework, we investigate the impact of storing only the fittest ancestors for use as a repair template. The influence of performing repair in a fixed direction is compared to randomly varying the direction in which error detection proceeds. Finally we explore the impact of varying the direction of repair on the results produced.

A total of 597 records of student-respondents in the evaluation of the faculty instructional performance, represented by 30 variables, from the four State Universities and Colleges (SUC) in Caraga Region, Philippines was used as the dataset. The simulation results showed that the proposed modification on the Average Crossover (AX) of the genetic algorithm outperformed the genetic algorithm with the original AX operator. The GA with IBAX operator combined with rank-based selection function had removed 20 or 66.66% of the variables while 13 or 43.33% of the variables were removed when GA with AX operator and roulette wheel selection function was used.},

Inspired by evolutionary biology, GA uses selection, crossover, and mutation operators to efficiently traverse the solution search space. This paper proposes nature inspired fine-tuning to the crossover operator using the untapped idea of Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA is a small subset of the overall DNA. It differentiates itself by inheriting entirely from the female, while the rest of the DNA is inherited equally from both parents. This unique characteristic of mtDNA can be an effective mechanism to identify members with similar genes and restrict crossover between them. It can reduce the rate of dilution of diversity and result in delayed convergence. In addition, we scale the well-known Island Model, where instances of GA are run independently and population members exchanged periodically, to a Continental Model. In this model, multiple web services are executed with each web service running an island model. We applied the concept of mtDNA in solving Traveling Salesman Problem and to train Neural Network for function approximation. Our implementation tests show that leveraging these new concepts of mtDNA and Continental Model results in relative improvement of the optimization quality of GA.},

Inteligent search algorithms can help to improve the performance of spatial search. This study will demonstrate that genetic algorithms can be used with Geographical Information systems (GIS) to effectively solve the spatial decision problems for optimally sitting n sites of a facility. Detailed population and transportation data from GIS are used to facilitate the calculation of fitness functions. Multiple planning objectives are also incorporated in the GA program. Experiments indicate that the proposed method has much better performance than simulated annealing and GIS neighborhood search methods.

Facility layout plays a key role for companies, and it is an inseparable part of the manufacturing system design process. Traditionally there are two approaches to the facility layout problem. One is the quantitative approach aiming at minimizing the total material handling cost and another is qualitative approach aiming at maximizing closeness rating score. In this paper both approaches have been taken into consideration separately. Again, the research also solved the problem combining these two approaches at the objective function level. Genetic algorithm (GA) is developed for the multi-objective facility layout problem and found out the optimal facility location for a particular problem considering the two objectives, i.e. minimization of the material handling cost and maximization of the closeness rating score. In GA, primarily an initial population is created and by the crossover operator and mutation process new offspring is generated and if the offspring meet the stopping criteria the result was selected for the process. From this approach, a non dominated solution set is found (Pareto optimal) approximately for the multi objective facility layout problem.},

	abstract = {A multi-offspring improved real-coded genetic algorithm (MOIRCGA) using the heuristical normal distribution and direction-based crossover (HNDDBX) is proposed to solve constrained optimization problems. Firstly, a HNDDBX operator is proposed. It guarantees the cross-generated offsprings are located near the better individuals in the population. In this way, the HNDDBX operator ensures that there is a great chance of generating better offsprings. Secondly, as iterations increase, the same individuals are likely to appear in the population. Therefore, it is possible that the two parents of participation crossover are the same. Under these circumstances, the crossover operation does not generate new individuals, and therefore does not work. To avoid this problem, the substitution operation is added after the crossover so that there is no duplication of the same individuals in the population. This improves the computational efficiency of MOIRCGA by leading it to quickly converge to the global optimal solution. Finally, aiming at the shortcoming of a single mutation operator which cannot simultaneously take into account local search and global search, a Combinational Mutation method is proposed with both local search and global search. The experimental results with sixteen examples show that the multi-offspring improved real-coded genetic algorithm (MOIRCGA) has fast convergence speed. As an example, the optimization model of the cantilevered beam structure is formulated, and the proposed MOIRCGA is compared to the RCGA in optimizing the parameters of the cantilevered beam structure. The optimization results show that the function value obtained with the proposed MOIRCGA is superior to that of RCGA.},

	abstract = {Genetic algorithm (GA) is a popular technique of optimization that is bio-inspired and based on Charles Darwin's proposed principles of natural genetics and natural selection theories. The algorithm operates on three simple genetic operators called selection, crossover and mutation. GA has many variations such as real coded and binary coded depending on the problem representation and so affects the forms of genetic operators. When optimizing process variables, the efficiency of crossover method is crucial. High efficiency of crossover operators enables minimizing the error occurred in engineering application optimization within a short time and cost. Unsuitable crossover method may cause inefficiency to explore the space of possible solutions thoroughly and effectively. This paper reviews crossover methods and problem representation, e.g. in the form of binary coded and real coded representation, used by researchers in order to solve engineering operations. It is expected that with the review of various types of crossovers, better insight in exploring new search spaces may be gained, and thus further varying the offsprings. At the end of the paper, some suggestions on how to achieve more efficient run of GA search in the scope of crossover technique in engineering applications are provided.},

The method, Gaussian Crossover Operator (GCO), utilizes the properties of Gaussian functions and Gaussian distribution for offspring generation. Each parent's fitness is evaluated in the context of general population by a heuristic function, i.e. the devised operator is performance based - the parents' individual fitness values act as a basis for a non-deterministic weighing mechanism. The child's gene value is a Gaussian Variable drawn upon the normal distribution determined by the overall state of the algorithm and the antecedent's evaluation. The performance of the algorithm is discussed and compared with the underlaying classical Genetic Algorithm and other GA implementations found in the literature; several test cases are considered. The results show that the proposed Gaussian Crossover Operator is feasible for solving optimization problems.},

	abstract = {The aim of Land-use Suitability Analysis and Planning Problem (LSAPP) is to identify the most suitable parcels of land for future land-uses considering several conflicting criteria. LSAPP can be modeled using a variant of a well-known combinatorial optimization problem called Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). In this paper, a multi-objective mathematical model is developed for LSAPP based on QAP modeling. The large-size instances of the proposed multi-objective mathematical model are difficult to solve in a reasonable CPU time using exact algorithms. So, an efficient three-phase hybrid solution procedure is proposed. In the first phase, the compensatory objectives are integrated using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory. Then, based on the aforementioned suitability objective function and other spatial objectives and constraints, a multi-objective LSAPP is constructed. Finally, a hybrid multiple objective meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the LSAPP. The core of the proposed algorithm is based on Scatter Search while Tabu Search and Variable Neighborhood Search are also utilized. The proposed algorithm is equipped with the concepts of Pareto optimality and Veto Threshold, which improve its efficacy. The proposed algorithm is applied on a real LSAPP case study, in ‘Persian Gulf Knowledge Village', wherein its performance is compared with a well-known evolutionary computation algorithm called Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA) using comprehensive statistical analysis. A survey on time complexity of the proposed algorithm is also accomplished. The results show that MOSVNS is significantly superior to VEGA both in single and in multi-objective modes. Furthermore, analysis of time complexity of the proposed algorithm shows that it is of polynomial time and can be applied to significantly larger problems with multiple compensatory and non-compensatory objectives.},

This paper outlines two novel optimizations of artificial neural network (ANN) using grey wolf optimization (GWO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO) metaheuristic algorithms in the Ardabil province, Iran. To this end, these algorithms are synthesized with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network for optimizing its computational parameters. The used spatial database consists of fourteen landslide conditioning factors, namely elevation, slope aspect, land use, plan curvature, profile curvature, soil type, distance to river, distance to road, distance to fault, rainfall, slope degree, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI) and lithology. 70% of the identified landslides are randomly selected to train the proposed models and the remaining 30% is used to evaluate the accuracy of them. Also, the frequency ratio theory is used to analyze the spatial interaction between the landslide and conditioning factors. Obtained values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as well as mean square error and mean absolute error showed that both GWO and BBO hybrid algorithms could efficiently improve the learning capability of the MLP. Besides, the BBO-based ensemble surpasses other implemented models.},

	abstract = {Agricultural landscapes presently cover about 46 % of earth terrestrial surface. This cultivated area is decreasing, whereas the global food demand is projected to increase up to 70 % in 2050. The intensification of agriculture is not a solution to this food issue because intensive agriculture has often resulted in pollution and loss of biodiversity. On the other hand, mechanistic models with optimization algorithms can be used to design alternative land uses for sustainable agriculture. Here, we present a review of metaheuristics for land use optimization reported in 50 articles including 38 case studies carried out in 16 countries. Our main conclusions are: 1) the success of metaheuristics is problem-dependent. In general, metaheuristics enable search to escape from local optima and find a good global approximation solution. 2) The choice of a given metaheuristic for solving a given problem seems to be driven by its historical use in a research team and by its popularity outside the metaheuristics research community, rather than by the characteristics of the problems to be solved and by the latest results from the metaheuristics research community. 3) Stakeholders of land use are increasingly involved at different levels of the land use optimization procedure and multi-actors decision-making methods are necessary to find trade-offs between their competing interests. 4) A future challenge is the use of parallelization techniques along with the hybridization of different metaheuristics or of metaheuristics with other optimization methods.},

We compared this method, which we called threshold accepting (TA), with the well-known simulated annealing (SA) method for discrete optimization. The empirical results demonstrated the superiority of the TA algorithm. In further experiments with the TA principle we discovered two new powerful optimization heuristics: The great deluge algorithm (GDA) and the record-to-record travel (RRT). These algorithms resemble in their structure the formerly studied TA and the SA method. The differences lie in their acceptance rules for worse intermediate solutions. Both, the GDA and the RRT, are essentially one-parameter algorithms; i.e., for the achievement of best possible performance, a good choice is necessary only for a single parameter. This is in contrast for instance to the classical AS algorithm, where it is necessary to choose carefully a certain sequence of parameters, the so-called annealing schedule. The quality of the computational results obtained so far by RRT and GDA shows that the new algorithms behave equally well as TA and thus a fortiori better than SA.},

However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang.

Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia.

This type of allocation is usually considered to be a complex multi-objective spatial optimization problem, whose optimized result is a set of Pareto-optimal solutions (Pareto front) reflecting different tradeoffs in several objectives. However, obtaining a Pareto front is a challenging task, and the Pareto front obtained by state-of-The-Art algorithms is still not sufficient. To achieve better Pareto solutions, taking the grid-representative land-use allocation problem with two objectives as an example, an artificial bee colony optimization algorithm for multi-objective land-use allocation (ABC-MOLA) is proposed. In this algorithm, the traditional ABC's search direction guiding scheme and solution maintaining process are modified. In addition, a knowledge-informed neighborhood search strategy, which utilizes the auxiliary knowledge of natural geography and spatial structures to facilitate the neighborhood spatial search around each solution, is developed to further improve the Pareto front's quality. A series of comparison experiments (a simulated experiment with small data volume and a real-world data experiment for a large area) shows that all the Pareto fronts obtained by ABC-MOLA totally dominate the Pareto fronts by other algorithms, which demonstrates ABC-MOLA's effectiveness in achieving Pareto fronts of high quality.},

	abstract = {Land use optimization as a resource allocation problem can be defined as the process of assigning different land uses to a region. Sustainable development also involves the exploitation of environmental resources, investment orientation, technology development, and industrial changes in a coordinated form. This paper studies the multi-objective sustainable land use planning problem and proposes an integrated framework, including simulation, forecasting, and optimization approaches for this problem. Land use optimization, a multifaceted process, requires complex decisions, including selection of land uses, forecasting land use allocation percentage, and assigning locations to land uses. The land use allocation percentage in the selected horizons is simulated and predicted by designing a System Dynamics (SD) model based on socio-economic variables. Furthermore, land use assignment is accomplished with a multi-objective integer programming model that is solved using augmented $\epsilon$-constraint and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) methods. According to the results of the SD model, land use changes depend on population growth rate and labor productivity variables. Among the possible scenarios, a scenario focusing more on sustainable planning is chosen and the forecasting results of this scenario are used for optimal land use allocation. The computational results show that the augmented $\epsilon$-constraint method cannot solve this problem even for medium sizes. The NSGA-II method not only solves the problem at large sizes over a reasonable time, but also generates good-quality solutions. NSGA-II showed better performance in metrics, including number of non-dominated Pareto solutions (NNPS), mean ideal distance (MID), and dispersion metric (DM). Integrated framework is implemented to allocate four types of land uses consisting of residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural to a given region with 900 cells.},

	abstract = {Considering the ever-increasing urban population, it appears that land management is of major importance. Land uses must be properly arranged so that they do not interfere with one another and can meet each other's needs as much as possible; this goal is a challenge of urban land-use planning. The main objective of this research is to use Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to find the optimum arrangement of urban land uses in parcel level, considering multiple objectives and constraints simultaneously. Geospatial Information System is used to prepare the data and to study different spatial scenarios when developing the model. To optimize the land-use arrangement, four objectives are defined: maximizing compatibility, maximizing dependency, maximizing suitability, and maximizing compactness of land uses. These objectives are characterized based on the requirements of planners. As a result of optimization, the user is provided with a set of optimum land-use arrangements, the Pareto-front solutions. The user can select the most appropriate solutions according to his/her priorities. The method was tested using the data of region 7, district 1 of Tehran. The results showed an acceptable level of repeatability and stability for the optimization algorithm. The model uses parcel instead of urban blocks, as the spatial unit. Moreover, it considers a variety of land uses and tries to optimize several objectives simultaneously. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The main problem which arises in the project is to subdivide the land into lots to be designated to the families. This problem is difficult since several constraints stemming from legal or ethical considerations have to be considered. Among the constraints are respecting natural reserves, balancing access to rivers with the size of the lots, and a fair distribution with respect to soil quality. This problem has been mainly solved manually until now. In this paper we propose a genetic algorithm to solve it. We present several algorithmic components including a constructive heuristic and recombination and mutation operators that take into account the specifics of the problem, propose a technique to generate artificial instances for testing, and report on experiments with five real-world and 25 artificial instances.},

During this process, various conflicting objectives are emerged which land use planners should prepare land use plans satisfying these objectives and deal with a large set of data and variable. For this reason, land use allocation is a multi-objective NP-hard optimization problem which is not solvable by the current exact methods. Therefore, solving land use optimization problem relies on the application of meta-heuristics. In this paper, a novel meta-heuristic named parallel particle swarm is developed to allocate seven land types (residential, commercial, cultural, educational, medical, sportive and green space) to Baboldasht district of Isfahan covered by 200 allocation cells with size 1000 m2 for maximizing compactness, compatibility and suitability objective functions. Afterwards, the outputs of the new developed algorithm are compared to the outputs of genetic algorithm. The results demonstrated that the parallel particle swarm is better than genetic algorithm in terms of both solution quality (1.35%) and algorithm efficiency (63.7%). The results also showed that the outputs achieved by both algorithms are better than the current state of land use distribution. Thus, the method represented in this paper can be used as a useful tool in the hands of urban planners and decision makers, and supports the land use planning process.},

The notion of 'smart cities' has been proposed as a solution to enhance the sustainability of cities through effective urban management of governance, energy and transportation. The research presented herein examines the applicability of a mathematical framework to enhance the sustainability of decisions involved in zoning, land-use allocation and facility location within smart cities. In particular, a mathematical optimisation framework is proposed, which links through with other platforms in city settings, for optimising the zoning, land-use allocation, location of new buildings and the investment decisions made regarding infrastructure works in smart cities. Multiple objective functions are formulated to optimise social, economic and environmental considerations in the urban space. The impact on underlying traffic of location choices made for the newly introduced buildings is accounted for through optimised assignment of traffic to the underlying network. A case example on urban planning and infrastructure development within a smart city is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.},

Handling and evaluating these large set of criteria (factors) is difficult in designing and solving facility layout problems. These factors and uncertainties have a large impact on manufacturing time, manufacturing cost, product quality and delivery performance. In order to operate efficiently, these facilities should adapt to these variations over multiple time periods and this must be addressed while designing an optimal layout. This paper proposes a novel integrated framework by combining Big Data Analtics and Hybrid meta-heuristic approach to design an optimal facility layout under stochastic demand over multiple periods. Firstly, factors affecting a facility layout design are identified. The survey is conducted to generate data reflecting 3V's of Big Data. Secondly, a reduced set of factors are obtained using Big Data Analytics. These reduced set of factors are considered to mathematically model a weighted aggregate objective for Multi-objective Stochastic Dynamic Facility Layout Problem (MO-SDFLP). Hybrid Meta-heuristic based on Firefly (FA) and Chaotic simulated annealing is used to solve the MO-SDFLP.

The performance of the hybrid multi-objective gray wolf optimization is tested on the production instances of panel block assembly in shipbuilding.

Despite the acceptable solutions derived from these algorithms, researchers in both academic and practical areas face the interesting question: can we develop an algorithm with better efficiency and solution quality? In the literature of operation research, hybridization, a combination of meta-heuristics, was introduced as a way of generating better algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims at developing novel algorithms through hybridizing Tabu search (TS), genetic algorithm (GA), GRASP, and simulated annealing (SA) and examining their quality and efficiency in practice. Accordingly, low-level teamwork GRASP–GA–TS (LLTGRGATS), high-level relay Greedy–GA–TS, and high-level teamwork SA were developed. Firstly, these algorithms were applied for solving small- and large-size single-row facility layout problem to evaluate their performance and functionality and to select the satisfactory algorithm in comparison with the other developed hybrids. Secondly, the selected algorithm, LLTGRGATS, and SVNS, a recent hybrid algorithm proposed for solving LUOP, were performed on a study area to solve a LUOP with two constraints and seven nonlinear objective functions. The outputs showed that the quality and efficiency of LLTGRGATS were slightly better than those of SVNS and it can be considered as a favorable tool for land-use planning process.},

	abstract = {As the main feature of land use planning, land use allocation (LUA) optimization is an important means of creating a balance between the land-use supply and demand in a region and promoting the sustainable utilization of land resources. In essence, LUA optimization is a multi-objective optimization problem under the land use supply and demand constraints in a region. In order to obtain a better sustainable multi-objective LUA optimization solution, the present study proposes a LUA model based on the multi-objective artificial immune optimization algorithm (MOAIM-LUA model). The main achievements of the present study are as follows: (a) the land-use supply and demand factors are analyzed and the constraint conditions of LUA optimization problems are constructed based on the analysis framework of the balance between the land use supply and demand; (b) the optimization objectives of LUA optimization problems are defined and modeled using ecosystem service value theory and land rent and price theory; and (c) a multi-objective optimization algorithm is designed for solving multi-objective LUA optimization problems based on the novel immune clonal algorithm (NICA). On the basis of the aforementioned achievements, MOAIM-LUA was applied to a real case study of land-use planning in Anlu County, China. Compared to the current land use situation in Anlu County, optimized LUA solutions offer improvements in the social and ecological objective areas. Compared to the existing models, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, experimental results demonstrate that the model designed in the present study can obtain better non-dominated solution sets and is superior in terms of algorithm stability.},

	abstract = {The existing grey wolf optimization algorithm has some disadvantages, such as slow convergence speed, low precision and so on. So this paper proposes a grey wolf optimization algorithm combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO_GWO). In this new algorithm, the Tent chaotic sequence is used to initiate the individuals' position, which can increase the diversity of the wolf pack. And the nonlinear control parameter is used to balance the global search and local search ability of the algorithm and improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. At the same time, the idea of PSO is introduced, which utilize the best value of the individual and the best value of the wolf pack to update the position information of each grey wolf. This method preserves the best position information of the individual and avoids the algorithm falling into a local optimum. To verify the performance of this algorithm, the proposed method is tested on 18 benchmark functions and compared with some other improved algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can better search global optimal solution and better robustness than other algorithm.},

	abstract = {A tabu search heuristic procedure is developed to solve the uncapacitated facility location problem. Tabu search is used to guide the solution process when evolving from one solution to another. A move is defined to be the opening or closing of a facility. The net cost change resulting from a candidate move is used to measure the attractiveness of the move. After a move is made, the net cost change of a candidate move is updated from its old value. Updating, rather than re-computing, the net cost changes substantially reduces computation time needed to solve a problem when the problem is not excessively large. Searching only a small subset of the feasible solutions that contains the optimal solution, the procedure is computationally very efficient. A computational experiment is conducted to test the performance of the procedure and computational results are reported. The procedure can easily find optimal or near optimal solutions for benchmark test problems from the literature. For randomly generated test problems, this tabu search procedure not only obtained solutions completely dominating those obtained with other heuristic methods recently published in the literature but also used substantially less computation time. Therefore, this tabu search procedure has advantage over other heuristic methods in both solution quality and computation speed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Bio-inspired computation is one of the emerging soft computing techniques of the past decade. Although they do not guarantee optimality, the underlying reasons that make such algorithms become popular are indeed simplicity in implementation and being open to various improvements. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), which derives inspiration from the hierarchical order and hunting behaviours of grey wolves in nature, is one of the new generation bio-inspired metaheuristics. GWO is first introduced to solve global optimization and mechanical design problems. Next, it has been applied to a variety of problems. As reported in numerous publications, GWO is shown to be a promising algorithm, however, the effects of characteristic mechanisms of GWO on solution quality has not been sufficiently discussed in the related literature. Accordingly, the present study analyses the effects of dominant wolves, which clearly have crucial effects on search capability of GWO and introduces new extensions, which are based on the variations of dominant wolves. In the first extension, three dominant wolves in GWO are evaluated first. Thus, an implicit local search without an additional computational cost is conducted at the beginning of each iteration. Only after repositioning of wolf council of higher-ranks, the rest of the pack is allowed to reposition. Secondarily, dominant wolves are exposed to learning curves so that the hierarchy amongst the leading wolves is established throughout generations. In the final modification, the procedures of the previous extensions are adopted simultaneously. The performances of all developed algorithms are tested on both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems including combinatorial problems such as uncapacitated facility location problem and 0-1 knapsack problem, which have numerous possible real-life applications. The proposed modifications are compared to the standard GWO, some other metaheuristic algorithms taken from the literature and Particle Swarm Optimization, which can be considered as a fundamental algorithm commonly employed in comparative studies. Finally, proposed algorithms are implemented on real-life cases of which the data are taken from the related publications. Statistically verified results point out significant improvements achieved by proposed modifications. In this regard, the results of the present study demonstrate that the dominant wolves have crucial effects on the performance of GWO.},

For solving complex real-world non-linear optimisation problems, the search equation provided in GWO is not of sufficient explorative behaviour. Therefore, in the present paper, an attempt has been made to increase the exploration capability along with the exploitation of a search space by proposing an improved version of classical GWO. The proposed algorithm is named as Cauchy-GWO. In Cauchy-GWO Cauchy operator has been integrated in which first two new wolves are generated with the help of Cauchy distributed random numbers and then another new wolf is generated by taking the convex combination of these new wolves. The performance of Cauchy-GWO is exhibited on standard IEEE CEC 2014 benchmark problem set. Statistical analysis of the results on CEC 2014 benchmark set and popular evaluation criteria, Performance Index (PI) proves that Cauchy-GWO outperforms GWO in terms of error values defined in IEEE CEC 2014 benchmarks collection. Later on in the paper, GWO and Cauchy-GWO algorithms have been used to solve three well-known engineering application problems and two problems of reliability. From the analysis conducted in the present paper, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm, Cauchy-GWO is reliable and efficient algorithm to solve continuous benchmark test problems, as well as real-life applications problems.},

The effectiveness of GWO algorithm on the two problems can give an idea about its possible application on solving other scheduling problems. For the discrete characteristics of the scheduling solutions, we developed a kind of discrete GWO algorithm with the objective of minimizing the maximum completion time (makespan). In the proposed algorithm, searching operator is designed based on the crossover operation to maintain the algorithm work directly in a discrete domain. Then an adaptive mutation method is introduced to keep the population diversity and avoid premature convergence. In addition, a variable neighborhood search method is embedded to further enhance the exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness, the discrete GWO algorithm is compared with other published algorithms in the literature for the two scheduling cases. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other algorithms for the scheduling problems under study.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a new meta-heuristic called Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) inspired by grey wolves (Canis lupus). The GWO algorithm mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. Four types of grey wolves such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega are employed for simulating the leadership hierarchy. In addition, the three main steps of hunting, searching for prey, encircling prey, and attacking prey, are implemented. The algorithm is then benchmarked on 29 well-known test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Programming (EP), and Evolution Strategy (ES). The results show that the GWO algorithm is able to provide very competitive results compared to these well-known meta-heuristics. The paper also considers solving three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) and presents a real application of the proposed method in the field of optical engineering. The results of the classical engineering design problems and real application prove that the proposed algorithm is applicable to challenging problems with unknown search spaces. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {A facility layout design is one of the most commonly faced problems in the manufacturing sectors. The problem is mixed-integer in nature and usually an NP-hard problem. Due to mixed-integer nature of the problem, it is difficult to solve the problem using classical optimization techniques. The classical optimization techniques are better for local search of the optimal solution. However, these algorithms are not efficient when there are multiple optimal solutions and alternate optimal solutions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposed a new interactive evolutionary algorithm based local search algorithm for solving static facility layout problems with unequal compartments. This is an iterative based two steps algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm creates the new solutions for the local search algorithm to obtain a local optimal solution. The designer can interact between these processes to derive the best possible solution of the problem. The objective function of the problem is non-linear one in which the sum of the material handling cost has been minimized. Apart from the conventional evolutionary operators, i.e. selection, crossover, mutation and elitism, this paper has also proposed exchange and rotation operators. The rotation operator is used to avoid mixed-integer formulation of the problem for the local search problem. The use of rotation operator has also reduced the number of variables of the problem significantly. The performance of the model is tested over previously solved problems selected from the literature. The evaluation of the results shows that the performance of the proposed model is better than many existing algorithms and has the potential for real-world applications.},

	abstract = {A hybrid optimization approach is presented for the layout design of unequal-area facilities. Simulated annealing is used to optimize a randomly generated initial placement on an `extended plane' considering the unequal-area facilities enclosed in magnified envelop blocks. An analytical method is then applied to obtain the optimum placement of each envelop block in the direction of steepest descent. Stepwise reduction of the sizes of the envelop blocks allows controlled convergence in a multi-phase optimization process. The presented test problems include two large size benchmark problems of 50 and 100 facilities of unequal areas. The results indicate that although the computational cost is relatively quite high, the technique is a significant improvement over previously published techniques for unequal-area facilities and can yield solutions of the same quality as obtained by PLANOPT, a general-purpose layout optimization program based on pseudo-exhaustive search.},

	abstract = {Dynamic facility layout problems involve devising the optimal layout for each different production period. This article studies unequal-area dynamic facility layout problems under fuzzy random environment to minimize the sum of the material handling costs and rearrangement costs. For a more general situation, a novel model of unequal-area dynamic facility layout problems is proposed on the basis of fuzzy random theory, in which uncertain demands are characterized by fuzzy random variables. Unequal-area dynamic facility layout problems are one of the non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problems. Therefore, a hybrid particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithm is innovated to solve the proposed unequal-area dynamic facility layout problems model under fuzzy random environment, in which the shapes and areas of facilities are changed dynamically. Two facility-swapping methods and two local search methods help hybrid algorithm escape from local optima, allowing a more reliable solution. Moreover, a new shifting method is developed to prevent the spatial overlapping between adjacent facilities and save material handling costs. The performance of the hybrid algorithm is confirmed by some test problems available. Finally, the proposed method is extended to a facility layout planning of a new aircraft assembly shop floor. Computational results show that the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method, in sharp comparison with other approaches.},

Generally, this problem allows the placement of the facilities in any location in any order without any restriction, but some practical SRFLP cases are required to meet various types of constraints imposed on the placement of its facilities in the engineering of the placement of factory machinery and equipment. According to this new perspective, we studied the constrained SRFLP (cSRFLP) in this paper. In this problem, a few facilities need to be placed in certain positions or specified orders with or without the requirement to be located next to each other. To address this novel layout problem, related constraints are defined and classified, and novel mixed-integer programming models for the problem are formulated. Subsequently, the CPLEX software is employed to solve this problem. Then a constrained improved fireworks algorithm is presented, which is discretised to solve the considered cSRFLP. Our computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing algorithms in solving the problem.},

The GWO algorithm mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. Four types of grey wolves such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega are employed for sim- ulating the leadership hierarchy. In addition, the three main steps of hunting, searching for prey, encir- cling prey, and attacking prey, are implemented. The algorithm is then benchmarked on 29 well-known test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Programming (EP), and Evolution Strategy (ES). The results show that the GWO algorithm is able to provide very com- petitive results compared to these well-known meta-heuristics. The paper also considers solving three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) and presents a real application of the proposed method in the field of optical engineering. The results of the classical engineering design problems and real application prove that the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied successfully in many fields. However, EAs cannot find an optimal solution on many occasions because the balance between exploration and exploitation is lost in runs. So far, tricking the balance is an important research topic in the field of evolutionary computation. Elitism strategy is a typical scheme applied in selection for the above purpose and can be widely used in different EAs. In this paper, we propose elitism and distance strategy based on the elitism strategy. According to our strategy, elites are still kept in selection for reducing genetic drift. Meanwhile, the individual among candidates for selection having the longest distance to each elite is also kept for maintaining diversity. We carry out experiments based on not only a genetic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem but also two differential evolution algorithms, DE/rand/2/bin and CoBiDE. Experimental results show that adding our strategy in all generations can significantly improve solutions of the genetic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. Moreover, calling our strategy at a low probability can significantly improve solutions of DE/rand/2/bin, while calling the strategy based on our proposed adaptive scheme can statistically improve solutions of CoBiDE, a state-of-the-art differential evolution algorithm.},

The job data such as processing times, release dates, due dates and sequence dependent setup times are considered. The goal is to optimize two different objectives: the makespan and the total tardiness. A mixed integer linear program is proposed to model the studied problem. As this problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, a metaheuristic method which is the second version of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is proposed to solve this problem. Since the parameters setting of a genetic algorithm is difficult, a fuzzy logic controller coupled with the NSGA-II (FLC-NSGA-II) is therefore proposed. The role of the fuzzy logic is to better set the crossover and the mutation probabilities in order to update the search ability. After that, an exact method based on the two phase method is also developed. We have used four measuring criteria to compare these methods.

	abstract = {This study was prompted by a recently published article in this journal on facility location by D. R. Sule. We show that the claim made by Sule of a novel and extremely simple algorithm yielding optimum solutions is not true. Otherwise, the algorithm would represent a breakthrough in decision-making for which a number of notoriously hard problems could be efficiently recast as location problems and easily solved. In addition, several variants of common location problems addressed by Sule are reviewed. In the last twenty years, many methods of accurately solving these problems have been proposed. In spite of their increased sophistication and efficiency, none of them claims to be a panacea. Therefore, researchers have concurrently developed a battery of fast but approximate solution techniques. Sule's method was essentially proposed by Kuehn and Hamburger in 1963, and has been adapted many times since. We exhibit several examples (including the one employed by Sule) in which Sule's algorithms lead to nonoptimal solutions. We present computational results on problems of size even greater than those utilized by Sule, and show that a method devised by Erlenkotter is both faster and yields better results. In a cost-benefit analysis of exact and approximate methods, we conclude that planning consists of generating an array of corporate scenarios, submitting them to the "optimizing black box," and evaluating their respective merits. Therefore, much is to be gained by eliminating the vagaries of the black box-that is, by using an exact method-even if the data collection and the model representation introduce sizable inaccuracies. Ironically, large problems (those that typically require most attention) cannot be solved exactly in acceptable computational times. Pending the imminent design of a new generation of exact algorithms, the best heuristics are those that guarantee a certain degree of accuracy of their solutions. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

	abstract = {The interest about hybrid optimization methods has grown for the last few years. Indeed, more and more papers about cooperation between heuristics and exact techniques are published. In this paper, we propose to extend an existing taxonomy for hybrid methods involving heuristic approaches in order to consider cooperative schemes between exact methods and metaheuristics. First, we propose some natural approaches for the different schemes of cooperation encountered, and we analyse, for each model, some examples taken from the literature. Then we recall and complement the proposed grammar and provide an annotated bibliography. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Li2012,
	abstract = {This paper deals with a multiobjective parallel machines scheduling problem. It consists in scheduling n independent jobs on m identical parallel machines. The job data such as processing times, release dates, due dates and sequence dependent setup times are considered. The goal is to optimize two different objectives: the makespan and the total tardiness. A mixed integer linear program is proposed to model the studied problem. As this problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, a metaheuristic method which is the second version of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is proposed to solve this problem. Since the parameters setting of a genetic algorithm is difficult, a fuzzy logic controller coupled with the NSGA-II (FLC-NSGA-II) is therefore proposed. The role of the fuzzy logic is to better set the crossover and the mutation probabilities in order to update the search ability. After that, an exact method based on the two phase method is also developed. We have used four measuring criteria to compare these methods. The experimental results show the advantages and the efficiency of FLC-NSGA-II. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Morrison2016,
	abstract = {The branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithmic framework has been used successfully to find exact solutions for a wide array of optimization problems. B&B uses a tree search strategy to implicitly enumerate all possible solutions to a given problem, applying pruning rules to eliminate regions of the search space that cannot lead to a better solution. There are three algorithmic components in B&B that can be specified by the user to fine-tune the behavior of the algorithm. These components are the search strategy, the branching strategy, and the pruning rules. This survey presents a description of recent research advances in the design of B&B algorithms, particularly with regards to these three components. Moreover, three future research directions are provided in order to motivate further exploration in these areas.},

@article{McKendall2006Ant,
	abstract = {Today's consumer market demands that manufacturers must be competitive. This requires the efficient operation of manufacturing plants and their ability to quickly respond to changes in product mix and demand. In addition, studies show that material-handling cost make up between 20 and 50 percent of the total operating cost. Therefore, this paper considers the problem of arranging and rearranging, when there are changes in product mix and demand, manufacturing facilities such that the sum of material handling and rearrangement costs is minimized. This problem is called the dynamic facility layout problem (DFLP). In this paper, hybrid ant systems (HASs) are developed to solve the DFLP. To test the performance of the meta-heuristics, two data sets taken from the literature are used in the analysis. The results show that the HASs are efficient techniques for solving the DFLP. More importantly, HASs found new best solutions for more than one-half of all the test problems. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.
