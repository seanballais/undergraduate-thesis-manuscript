\chapter{What should be in the Appendix}

What goes in the appendices? Any material which impedes the smooth
development of your presentation, but which is important to justify the
results of a thesis. Generally it is material that is of too nitty-gritty
a level of detail for inclusion in the main body of the thesis, but which
should be available for perusal by the examiners to convince them
sufficiently. Examples include program listings, immense tables of data,
lengthy mathematical proofs or derivations, etc.
