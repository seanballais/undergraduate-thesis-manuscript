\chapter{Conclusion and Summary}

In this study, we proposed an alternative approach to the static unequal area facility layout problem, which was previously solved using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. Our alternative approach utilizes the grey wolf optimization to solve the problem. We have introduced modifications to this metaheuristic in order for it to be able to produce feasible solutions. We have compared this modified GWO against a GA-based hybrid approach. Results from our experiment indicate that the GA-based approach is generally than our modified GWO. However, they showed that there is promise in GWO as an algorithm for solving FLPs. In one data set, our approach produced results faster than the GA-based approach, despite producing an average result that is slightly worse than the other approach. Our approach is also simpler, making it easier to understand and experiment with. In the future, our proposed modified GWO may be further improved to produce significantly better results. Besides, GWO is relatively new to the field, providing researchers with plentiful opportunities to improve the algorithm. Modifying the equations of our modified GWO, such as the decay rate of $\alpha$, is one avenue in which researchers may take to build upon our study.
